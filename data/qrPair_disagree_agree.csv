even if that worked the u s , like russia and a few other nuclear powers , keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over , and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army so it would never happen that the u s would be left nuclear naked but lets assume that happened \( maybe during a really , really cool party some xxxxx colonel peed on them , and they just fried \) the genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air , ground and sea you still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the u s probably spend several trillion doing it \( i know , thats a pretty low number for the invasion of america \) , and in that case most likely have satellites and long range missiles \( again lets assume somehow americas own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all americas nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event \) the hugest , most glaring problem with the militia , unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop , they would have to gather and if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in , to order to defeat the large invading army , they would be taken out very easily by 1 icbms launched from enemy subs 2 prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1 5 mile range and superb training and intelligence \( remember those satellites \) 3 all groups preparing for battle so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars , ambushes , rockets , infantry rushes , tank columns etc before they knew what hit them 4 it would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight , and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability , they would still need satellites for the military genius in california to command units in n y , n y , and wait americas satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that , it would n't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit \( effectively sitting ducks \) and any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection but militia units only have guns , and they would get their butts whooped , even with massive numbers what you are saying is only true about napoleonic tactics , in todays modern warfare almost completely infantry based armies are obsolete and very venerable no the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint , the terrain was different , the people are more hardened , the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the russians , the afghans had unlimited anti tank reserves , had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide , plan and attack , only had to defeat , on the majority , other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross , the russians were under funded and their moral low , the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking soviet empire , china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence , afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back up by the very crappy russian naval forces , the afghans received help from the rest of the arab world which would not happen with the u s because if an enemy can take out the u s , it could probably take out the combined forces of europe and north america , and , finally , the afgans did n't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands , but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan , the americans would be defended their homeland neither is the french revolution a good counter point , as i have said , your tactics only work with napoleonic style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when napoleon the 3rd was in power \?

if ken ham said that it would not mean much what they are both saying is that the people who promote the dinosaurs to birds scenario are lying propagandist , not scientist just so you ca n't say i took it out of context here is dr olsen 's letter in it 's entirety national museum of natural history smithsonian institution washington , d c 20560 1 november 1999 open letter to dr peter raven , secretary praven nas org committee for research and exploration national geographic society washington , dc 20036 dear peter , i thought that i should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the national geographic society with the publication of feathers for t rex \? by christopher p sloan in its november issue , national geographic has reached an all time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism but at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature although it is possible that mr czerkas will later name the specimen identified on page 100 as archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so because this latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full spread photograph of the specimen accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , the name archaeoraptor liaoningensis sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in national geographic \( international code of zoological nomenclature , article 13a , i \) this is the worst nightmare of many zoologists that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist clearly , national geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that the czerkases now plan to return it to china in washington , in june of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th international meeting of the society of avian paleontology and evolution , held at the smithsonian institution , were signatories to a letter to the director of the chinese academy of sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from china and encouraged the chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation there were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message thus , at least since mid 1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from liaoning offered for sale outside of china are contraband most , if not all , major natural history museums in the united states have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin the national geographic society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions prior to the publication of the article dinosaurs take wing in the july 1998 national geographic , lou mazzatenta , the photographer for sloan 's article , invited me to the national geographic society to review his photographs of chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story at that time , i tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what national geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that national geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that makes the news rather than reporting it his bald statement that we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing this melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned more importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact the statement on page 103 that hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical the hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the national geographic society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers a model of the undisputed dinosaur deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction the idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at nature and national geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion if sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken but it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , national geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode sincerely , storrs

239@3,i thought it would be nice to start a thread where people can express their views on the issue of abortion in a more detailed way than they might when responding in a debate,"following the original purpose of this thread , i will summarize my own views on abortion \( note , this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs a thread in the abortion forum called survey of views on abortion \) for me , the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus on the side of the rights of the mother , there is a very important right to the control over one 's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one 's will some may say that , in agreeing to have sex , a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy , but i strongly disagree a pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used it would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood the great majority of sex acts for both married and unmarried women , religious or non religious , conservative or liberal are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and or purely physical reasons pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts so , women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex in the case of unwanted pregnancies , it is a significant burden that they never agreed to if they are forced to carry such a pregnancy , it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies on the other hand , one has the rights of the fetus what rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities for me , the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence at least a rudimentary mind i believe that i did not exist until i started to mentally exist and that applies to all others my view is that , once a mental existence begins , the right to life of a fetus kicks in and takes priority over the mother 's rights over her own body , under most circumstances the neurological view is that a mind cannot exist before the third trimester therefore , i would allow abortion on demand for the first and second trimester and restrict it in the third trimester for that third trimester , i would limit abortions to those that are done to mitigate a significant risk to the mother 's life or physical or mental health \( ex leading to , say , paralysis or strong possibility of suicide , etc \) and , in case of severe incurable deformations of the fetus discovered late , to end the life of a fetus that would otherwise strongly suffer \( i e mercy killing \) otherwise , i believe abortions should be restricted if a woman has not decided on an abortion by the third trimester , she should have to carry the pregnancy to term \( minus the perviously mentioned exceptions \) she would have had ample time to decide lastly , here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester part 4 of http www 2think org abortion shtml http 7e devbio com article php \? ch 21 amp id 162",abortion,1

290@1,what makes you so certain that the minority is right on this issue \?,"well , now this is the question that really matters , and the answer is a long one but to state it as simply as possible denying same sex marriage hurts many people it forces same sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages it denies them access to raise children and ability to cover their children and spouses with their medical insurance , along with the many other benefits of marriage it uses the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion held by same sex couples is wrong , and this forces them to feel the disapproval of society there is no reason to perpetuate these harms i have heard many arguments opposed to same sex marriage , but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms in fact , i would even say that there is not one argument against same sex marriage that makes logical sense at all thus , even if same sex marriage brought no benefits , there would be no reason to keep it illegal a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone , unless it has a very good reason to and there just is n't any reason to deny rights and benefits to same sex couples",gay marriage,0

the shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights , but tv networks are outraged , citing the fact the weapon was not loaded the incident stems from a show aired jan 17 by biwako broadcasting co almost four months later , police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items , including a script and a dvd of the show critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives , but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant shiga prefectural police regard the incident , in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed tv personality noburo harada , 57 , to momentarily handle the rifle during the show , as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms so much so , in fact , that on june 12 , the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors as a result , the hunter , aged 49 , along with a 60 year old tv producer and a 37 year old director of the show , could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law police did not pursue a case against harada even though he briefly handled the weapon police argued that he did not actually possess the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken the show , called tokimeki shiga's , is broadcast one saturday a month in the show , harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide the program in question was set in yogo , where harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat the hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene he offered the unloaded weapon to harada and asked , do you want to hold it \? harada held the rifle and commented , it 's heavy , is n't it \? adding , not everybody has a chance to hold it , right \? he held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back biwako broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised the tv crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting the prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer the intervention by the police flabbergasted harada and employees of other tv stations i never could have imagined anything like this , harada , a former member of the male comedy duo anonenone , told reporters after he was questioned by police on june 2 i was stunned akihiko ito , head of the tv station 's programming department , said the station would cooperate with police , but defended harada 's actions we consulted our lawyers , and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it , he said a spokesperson with a tv station based in osaka sharply criticized police they should have at least asked \( biwako broadcasting \) to cooperate voluntarily , a spokesperson said from a common sense standpoint , we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking an employee at another tv station was also critical if we , for example , were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife , would the police investigate us , too \? the employee asked such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs this would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming but police say they do n't understand what all the fuss is about they say the media has , by focusing on the celebrity angle , blurred the facts in the case a senior official with the shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that harada briefly held the rifle , but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of storage and management an explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law , which took effect in january the law was tightened after a 37 year old man in sasebo , nagasaki prefecture , shot and killed two people and wounded six in december 2007 the man , known for erratic behavior , committed suicide after the shooting the incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm 's potential danger , another police official said according to the national police agency , police can file a case against anybody if he or she , with criminal intent to kill or injure people , possesses a weapon for even a second a case can be built based not on the length of time of possession , but on the purpose of possession , the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner the shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show by transporting the gun to the show , the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit , police asserted they defended questioning harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon \? takaaki hattori , professor of media law at rikkyo university in tokyo , says that police went too far the way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing i sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law , he said they should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities but he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent the tv station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show the gun owner may have been primarily responsible , but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law takaaki matsumiya , professor of criminal law at ritsumeikan university school of law in kyoto , disagrees that the tv station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities citing a precedent set by the tokyo high court in june 1967 , he said the high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession , ' he said there have been no precedents to alter that interpretation harada did not 'possess' it \( during the show \) matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set when the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason' for bearing and carrying a firearm , it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm , he said it is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances \( iht asahi july 2 , 2009 \) now then , what 's all this bull about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to america \?

the problem is that we do n't know what the intention of everyone is , and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are american citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them of course a semi automatic 223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon , but the point is that \( i think \) most people do n't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want , so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own i do n't think that i covered all of your points , patriot , but this is getting long , so i will cut this off here , and i hope to get a response from you i will be interested in your thoughts dan","the ban on assault weapons stands on such poltically weak and constitutionally weak ground that congress only had the guts and the will to try it for 10 years it expires this year the right to own arms is expressly clear it shall not be infringed by congress the federal government is fully empowed to keep arms away from convicted fellons , it does not have the power to limit them from citizens those people who you do n't know \( what they may do \) \? when the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so , then we no longer live in a free society keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law it cuts both ways , you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free the only governments through history that have been effective in crime prevention has been tyranically communist countries with extensive secret police the present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime , they recall back in the day how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey yes they were safe from criminals , they were not safe from the secret police the moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy , you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again the wmd analogy is poor you will not find any vendors please find another one there may be constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning wmds for civilians , that argument is moot you will not find any vendor the constitution protects my right to own arms that does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if i want one that argument is moot the firearms act decided that sawed off shot guns and the thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership early supreme court decisions support this early judicial opinion of the the firearms act was based on the fact that the thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd amendment the thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the us army guess what \? the thompson was adpoted by the army a few years later so then , what does that mean \? judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd amendment what does that mean for the assault rifle ban \? it means it is on shakey constitutional ground some points i have for you 1 \) flash supressor \? argued by anti gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position completely false flash hiders can hide flash from the target it 's main purpose is to hide flash from the shooter ! the flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle , causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy http www shootingsoftware com loadens htm flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end the flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives 2 \) magazine limit \? argued by anti gunners to save lives argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims true , but how often do you hear that \? when it does happen it is national news the real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets http ip bmjjournals com cgi content abstract 9 2 151 the anti gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next they just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity so then the ban on more than 10 bullets \? it really does not do anything than give a false sense of security if public policy productive and actally do something , then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce 3 \) bayonet \? i can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons simly because they look dangerous i suppose is why they are banned will someone please let me know \? public policy should not be based on emotional reasons to be truely good and effective policy 4 \) pistol grip \? they make controling an automatic weapon easier to sight on your target well then , if you rifle is semi auto , then what reason is there to ban them \?",gun control,1

it is in reality far more restrictive than the expired federal ban ! i dont know if it is being sold as merely a common sense state enactment of the old federal ban that expired and no longer protects us , but if it is , then here is why that argument is fraudulent the old federal ban was far less restrictive because it defined an aw \( in addition to some firearms deemed automatically an aw \) as having 2 or more of the cosmetic features , while this new statute says it needs only 1 cosmetic feature that is a significant difference which allows this proposed law to capture many more firearms than the old federal ban it looks like the old federal ban definitions were used as a template for this new statute , but whoever wrote it decided to change it down to 1 offending cosmetic feature knowing full well it would ban far more firearms if i were you i would let my legislator know this difference for comparison , here are the aw definitions from the old federal aw ban 18 u s c 921 is a listing of how terms are defined in the firearms offenses portion of the code , and it defines a federally banned aw as follows \( 30 \) the term semiautomatic assault weapon means \( a \) any of the

figure why or how it got there other than by way of noah 's flood and here 's a scholarly article from the biblical perspective that points out the different interpretations theologians consider , both conservative and liberal http www grisda org origins 22058 htm biblical evidence for the universality of the genesis flood richard m davidson john nevin andrews professor of old testament interpretation old testament department andrews university , berrien springs , michigan origins 22 \( 2 \) 58 73 \( 1995 \) what this article is about the extent of the genesis flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars for those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive , twenty four days , a universal flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column the thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal , universal , world wide genesis flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data the author summarizes twenty two lines of biblical evidence including terminological , thematic , contextual , grammatical syntactical , literary structural , logical conceptual , theological , canonical , and typological which support the universality of the genesis flood please note unfortunately , we are unable to reproduce all of the special accent marks that were present in our printed version of the hebrew transliteration our apologies for any inconvenience this might cause i conflicting schools of interpretation one of the most controversial aspects of the flood narrative concerns the extent of the genesis flood three major positions are taken \( 1 \) the traditional , which asserts the universal , world wide , nature of the deluge \( 2 \) limited or local flood theories , which narrow the scope of the flood story to a particular geographical location in mesopotamia and \( 3 \) non literal \( symbolic \) interpretation , which suggests that the flood story is a non historical account written to teach theological truth against this third position , the non historical , we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the flood in the literary structure of the flood story \( see shea 1979 \) , the genealogical frame or envelope construction \( genesis 5 32 and 9 28 29 \) plus the secondary genealogies \( genesis 6 9 10 and 9 18 19 \) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history the use of the genealogical term tledt \( generations , account \) in the flood story \( 6 9 \) as throughout genesis \( 13 times , structuring the whole book \) , indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of genesis \( doukhan 1978 , p 167 220 \) walter kaiser analyzes the literary form of genesis 1 11 and concludes that this whole section of genesis must be taken as historical narrative prose \( kaiser 1970 \) a number of references in the book of job may allude to the then relatively recent flood \( job 9 5 8 12 14 15 14 11 12 22 15 17 26 10 14 28 9 38 8 11 see morris 1988 , p 26 30 \) the historical occurrence of the flood is part of the saving judging acts of god , and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing flood typology \( see davidson 1981 , p 326 327 \) more on this point later thus according to the biblical writers , far from being a non historical , symbolical , or mythical account written only to teach theological truths , the flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real , literal , historical event for evangelical christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the flood account , the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local , limited flood or a universal , world wide cataclysm the limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological , biological , and anthropological problems for a universal flood \( see boardman 1990 , p 212 223 custance 1979 , p 28 58 kidner 1967 , p 93 95 mitchell 1982 1993 ramm 1954 , p 232 249 young 1977 , p 171 210 \) since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article , i can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable , although much more study is needed a number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long age geology \( see coffin and brown 1983 roth 1985 , 1986a , 1988 whitcomb 1988 baumgardner 1994a , b \) the local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense the various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality they are seen to indicate universality within the writer 's world view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view \( see boardman 1990 , p 223 226 custance 1979 , p 15 27 kidner 1967 , p 93 95 ramm 1954 , p 241 242 \) we will take up this issue in the next section of this article the traditional conservative understanding of the flood narrative is that genesis 6 9 describes a universal , world wide deluge it should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal critical commentators on genesis 6 9 , although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ane accounts and not historical \( see hasel 1975 , p 78 and note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position fohrer , koehler , noth , procksch , skinner , sarna , speiser , von rad , vriezen , zimmerli , etc some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article \) the thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal , universal world wide flood does full justice to the biblical data , and this universal interpretation is crucial for flood theology in genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers ii biblical terminology in genesis 6 9 indicating universality perhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal flood is the specific all inclusive terminology found within the genesis account itself the late gerhard hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of origins \( hasel 1974 , 1975 , 1978 \) , and therefore i need not go into detail in this article eight different terms or phrases in genesis 6 9 , most echoing their counterparts in the world wide creation account of genesis 1 2 , indicate universality first , the term haares the earth , occurring 46 times in the flood narrative \( genesis 6 12 , 13 , 17 , etc \) , always without any accompanying genitive of limitation , clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world wide , universal creation in genesis 1 1 , 2 , 10 \( while the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain land , the explicit link to creation in the flood account \( see especially genesis 6 6 , 7 \) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in genesis 6 9 \) some have argued that if moses had wished to indicate the entire world , he would have used the hebrew term tebel , which means the world as a whole , or dry land in the sense of continents this word is never used in the flood narrative but it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire pentateuch , including the creation account in fact , the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the hebrew bible , but only in poetic texts \( 39 times \) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with haares the earth thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology , and carries little weight a second expression , upon the face of all the earth al pen kol haares \( genesis 7 3 8 9 \) , clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation \( genesis 1 29 cf genesis 1 2 for a related universal expression \) , and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension , i e , the entire surface of the global mass while the shortened term all the earth \( kol haares \) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context \( see exodus 10 5 , 15 numbers 22 5 , 11 1 kings 4 34 10 24 2 chronicles 36 23 genesis 41 57 \) , the immediate context of the flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom god had made and created \( genesis 6 6 , 7 \) to have dominion over all the earth \( genesis 1 26 \) , and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the tower of babel upon the face of all the earth \( genesis 11 4 , 8 , 9 \) in each of the four occurrences of the phrase upon the face of all the earth in genesis outside the flood story \( genesis 1 29 11 4 , 8 , 9 \) , it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe , and there is nothing in the flood narrative to indicate any less universality \( it should be also noted that the one place in genesis where in context a similar phrase upon all the face of the earth is not universal the famine mentioned in genesis 41 56 , the hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in genesis al kol pen haares \) third , the phrase face of the ground pen haadamah \( five times in the flood narrative , 7 4 , 22 , 23 8 8 , 13 \) , occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted , the earth \( 7 23 \) and face of all the earth \( 8 9 \) and this phrase face of the ground likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation \( genesis 2 6 \) fourth , the term kol basar all flesh occurs 12 times in genesis 6 9 \( genesis 6 12 , 13 , 17 , 19 7 16 , 21 8 17 9 11 , 15 , 16 , 17 \) the word kol all \( which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands \) , before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix , as here in genesis 6 9 , indicates totality god 's announcement to destroy all flesh \( genesis 6 13 , 17 \) and the narrator 's comment that all flesh died \( genesis 7 21 22 \) , except the inhabitants of the ark , indicates universal destruction the one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar all the flesh \( in genesis 7 15 \) likewise indicates totality as well as unity fifth , the expression every living thing \( kol hahay \) of all flesh \( genesis 6 19 \) , is another expression of totality in 7 4 , 23 , the similar term kol hayeqm means literally , all existence this term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation all existence that i have made \( 7 4 \) and by the exclusive statement only noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive \( 7 23 \) as hasel puts it there is hardly any stronger way in hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed the writer of the genesis flood story employed terminology , formulae , and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal , world wide flood \( hasel 1975 , p 86 \) sixth , the phrase under the whole heaven \( tahat kol haamayim , genesis 7 19 \) , is used six times in the ot outside of the flood narrative , and always with a universal meaning \( see deuteronomy 2 25 4 19 job 28 24 37 3 41 11 daniel 9 12 \) for example , the phrase is used to describe god 's omniscience for he looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens \( job 28 24 \) again , it depicts god 's sovereignty whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine \( job 41 11 kjv \) \( note that the usage in deuteronomy 2 25 , describing the nations under the whole heaven , is further qualified and limited by the phrase who shall hear the report of you , and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense \) the universal phrase under the whole heaven or under all the heavens also universalizes the phrase under heaven \( genesis 6 17 \) in this same flood context the word heaven alone can have a local meaning e g , 1 kings 18 45 , but here the context is clearly universal ecclesiastes , which contains numerous allusions to creation , likewise utilizes the term under heaven with a universal intention \( ecclesiastes 1 13 2 3 3 1 cf the parallel universal expression under the sun in ecclesiastes 1 3 , 9 2 11 , 17 etc \) in the flood account this phrase under the whole heaven is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the flood and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered the waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward , and the mountains were covered \( 7 19 , 20 \) critical scholar john skinner notes that 7 19 , 20 not only asserts its the flood 's universality , but so to speak proves it , by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains \( skinner 1930 1956 , p 165 \) the biblical language here simply cannot be explained in terms of a local sky , and certainly cannot refer to the local mountains being covered by snow , as some proponents of a local flood suggest h c leupold points out that the writer of vs 19 is not content with a single use of kol \( all \) in all the high mountains , but since 'all' is known to be used in a relative sense , the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens ' a double 'all' \( kol \) cannot allow for so relative a sense it almost constitutes a hebrew superlative so we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the flood \( leupold 1942 , p 301 302 \) seventh , hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase all the fountains mayenoth of the great deep tehm rabbah \( genesis 7 11 8 2 \) , and showed how it is linked with the universal deep \( tehm \) or world ocean in genesis 1 2 \( cf psalm 104 6 thou didst cover it the earth with deep tehm as with a garment the waters were standing above the mountains \) the breaking up and bursting forth \( i e , geological faulting \) of not just one subterranean water spring in mesopotamia , but of all the fountains of the great deep , coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens , far transcends a local scene hasel perceptively concludes that the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about \( hasel 1974 , p 71 \) eighth , in another article , hasel \( 1978 \) shows how the hebrew bible reserved a special term mabbl which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal genesis flood \( 12 occurrences in genesis , once in psalm 29 10 \) this word may be derived from the hebrew root ybl to flow , to stream the term mabbl , which in the flood narrative is usually associated with mayim waters , seems to have become a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood \( deluge \) being caused by waters mabbl is in the old testament a term consistently employed for the flood \( deluge \) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters \( hasel 1978 , p 92 93 \) this technical term clearly sets the genesis deluge apart from all local floods , and is utilized in the psalm 29 10 to illustrate yahweh 's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the noahic flood the lord sat enthroned at the flood , and the lord sits as king forever summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the flood in genesis 6 9 , hasel writes the genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style it expects to be taken literally there is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe to read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects \( hasel 1975 , p 87 \) iii other biblical evidence for a universal flood many additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion we will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text first , the trajectory of major themes in genesis 1 11 creation , fall , plan of redemption , spread of sin is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment we have already noted in reference to specific flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation the creation of the heavens and the earth certainly is not local in scope according to genesis 1 2 likewise , the fall of humanity in adam and eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race \( hadam \) , not just the inhabitants of mesopotamia \( see genesis 6 5 , 11 romans 3 19 5 12 \) again , the protoevangelium \( first gospel promise \) outlined in genesis 3 15 , involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants \( or seed \) of the serpent and the spiritual descendants \( seed \) of the woman , culminating in the victory of the representative messianic seed over the serpent \( see robertson 1980 \) this plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope in a similar way , the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the flood includes more than those living in the fertile crescent from god 's perspective , not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator , we have the results of the divine investigative judgment and god saw that the wickedness of man \( hadam , humankind \) was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually \( genesis 6 5 \) such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment second , the divine purpose given for the bringing of the flood makes explicit its universal scope and the lord said , 'i will destroy man \( hadam \) , humanity whom i have created from the face of the earth both man , and beast , creeping things and birds of the air , for i am sorry that i have made them \( genesis 6 7 \) nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race \( except for noah , 6 8 \) seems envisaged given the length of time from creation \( over 1650 years minimum \) , the longevity of the antediluvians \( nearly a thousand years \) , and god 's command at creation to fill the earth \( genesis 1 28 \) , it is highly unlikely that the pre flood population would have stayed only in mesopotamia thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local flood third , the genealogical lines from both adam \( genesis 4 17 26 5 1 31 \) and noah \( genesis 10 1 32 11 1 9 \) are exclusive in nature , indicating that as adam was father of all pre flood humanity , so noah was father of all post flood humanity from the descendants of noah the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood \( genesis 10 32 \) , and the tower of babel experience spreads humanity across the globe \( genesis 11 1 19 \) striking extra biblical evidence that all human races , and not just the nations of the fertile crescent , are included in the descendants of noah , and retain memory of the universal flood , is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth \( see frazer 1918 , 1 105 361 nelson 1931 \) a world wide flood is by far the most frequently given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity \( thompson 1955 , 1 182 194 \) a remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin , and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea faring vessel the stories nearest to the area of the dispersion at babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account \( see heidel 1946 , jacobsen 1981 , and lambert and millard 1969 \) this vast body of ancient witnesses to a world wide deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical flood fourth , the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both adam and noah \( genesis 1 28 9 1 \) this is another linkage between universal creation and the flood , between the original beginning and the new beginning as the human race at creation flows from adam and eve , so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through noah fifth , the covenant \( genesis 9 9 10 \) with its rainbow sign \( genesis 9 12 17 \) is clearly linked to the extent of the flood , and includes the whole earth \( genesis 9 13 17 \) if there was only a local flood , then the covenant would be only a limited covenant , and the rainbow sign of the all embracing universality of the divine mercy \( delitzsch 1888 1976 , 1 289 290 \) would be stripped of its meaning sixth , the viability of god 's promise \( genesis 9 15 cf isaiah 54 9 \) and the integrity of god in keeping his promise is wrapped up in the world wide extent of the flood this point cannot be underscored too heavily if genesis 6 9 describes only a local flood , then god has broken his promise every time another local flood has happened ! the only way god 's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing \( genesis 8 21 \) can be seen to have been kept is if the flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed seventh , the universality of the flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in genesis 6 14 15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark \( genesis 6 16 21 7 2 3 \) a massive ark filled with representatives of all non aquatic animal plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood , for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds \( genesis 6 19 20 \) as a matter of fact , if only a local flood were in view , the building of any ark at all , even for noah and his family , would have been superfluous god could simply have warned noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment , just as he did with lot in sodom but the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape in the midst of the flood only noah and those who were with him in the ark remained \( genesis 7 23 \) eighth , the covering of all the high mountains by at least 15 cubits \( genesis 7 19 20 \) could not involve simply a local flood , since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe even one high mountain covered in a local mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet 's surface in this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as mt everest at the time of the flood , and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles , as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary \( see ramm 1954 , p 242 \) the antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present passages in the book of job and psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift \( see job 9 5 28 9 and psalm 104 7 8 \) also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise , namely , that a world wide flood would imply that the earth 's surface was completely renovated during the flood year and thus prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography this implication , they claim , is in conflict with biblical evidence which strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography \( young 1977 , p 210 \) reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the garden of eden the lands of havilah and cush , and the four rivers , two of which \( the tigris and the euphrates \) were familiar to the readers of genesis in moses' time what is not recognized in these arguments , however , is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography , there are more differences than similarities two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in moses' time the pishon and gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow , in the postdiluvian areas of havilah and cush respectively the other two rivers the tigris and euphrates are described as coming from a common source in the garden of eden , certainly far different from their present courses thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of genesis are in harmony with a world wide flood also , it is likely that survivors of the flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the flood , even though the earth 's surface looked entirely different ninth , the duration of the flood makes sense only with a universal flood the deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days \( genesis 7 17 \) , and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the flood began the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months , and the flood waters were not dried up enough for noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed \( see genesis 7 11 8 14 \) such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood tenth , the receding activity of the water \( genesis 8 3a , 54a \) is described by hebrew phrases which , in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the to and fro motion of the raven \( genesis 8 7 \) , should be translated as going and retreating , \( see austin 1990 , p 218 hasel 1978 , p 93 \) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days \( see genesis 8 3 5 \) the waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased , supports a universal interpretation such as the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood \( austin 1990 , p 218 \) , but is incongruous with a local flood theory eleventh , the nt passages concerning the flood all employ universal language swept them all away \( matthew 24 39 \) destroyed them all , \( luke 17 27 \) he did not spare the ancient world , but preserved noah with seven other persons , when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly \( 2 peter 2 5 \) a few , that is eight persons , were saved through water \( 1 peter 3 20 \) noah condemned the world \( hebrews 11 7 \) a local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world as archer states , we have the unequivocal corroboration of the new testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal \( archer 1985 , p 208 \) twelfth , the nt flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity , but also the universality , of the flood to theologically argue for an imminent world wide judgment by fire \( 2 peter 3 6 7 \) peter argues that just as there was a world wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish , so in the antitype there must needs be a universal end time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly \( see davidson 1981 , p 326 327 \) thirteenth , key terms and motifs that we have already noted in genesis 6 9 converge to make a major theological statement the noahic flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the flood narrative nahum sarna writes that the flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation in other words , creation is being undone , and the world returned to chaos \( sarna 1989 , p 48 \) tikva frymer kensky describes the flood as the original , cosmic undoing of creation \( frymer kensky 1983 , p 410 cf frymer kensky 1985 , p 312 \) claus westermann speaks of the invasion of chaos into the created order the flood assumed cosmic proportions \( westermann 1974 1984 , p 434 \) umberto cassuto points out that at the high point of the flood , we see water everywhere , as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of creation , when the waters of the deep submerged everything \( cassuto 1964 , p 97 \) david clines uses the apt term bouleversement or reversal of creation to depict the theological significance of the flood \( clines 1972 , p 136 \) for joseph blenkinsopp , the deluge is an act of uncreation , undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval , watery chaos from which the created order first arose \( blenkinsopp 1992 , p 83 cf blenkinsopp 1971 , p 46 47 \) gerhard von rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation we must understand the flood , therefore , as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos when the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below , and the primeval sea beneath the earth , which is restrained by god , now freed from its bonds , gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth , then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology the two halves of the chaotic primeval sea , separated the one up , the other below by god 's creative government \( ch 1 7 9 \) , are again united creation begins to sink into chaos here the catastrophe , therefore , concerns not only men and beasts but the earth \( chs 6 13 9 1 \) indeed , the entire cosmos \( von rad 1972 , p 128 \) only a cosmic universal flood can theologically encompass the cosmic universal reversal or undoing of creation described in genesis 6 9 fourteenth and last , the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic new beginning as clines states it the 'uncreation' which god has worked with the flood is not final creation has not been permanently undone old unities of the natural world are restored \( 8 22 \) , and the old ordinances of creation are renewed \( 9 1 7 \) \( clines 1972 73 , p 138 \) jacques doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of re creation in the aftermath of the flood \( genesis 8 9 \) and the seven days of creation in genesis 1 2 \( doukhan 1987 , p 133 134 cf gage 1984 , p 10 20 \) the wind over the earth and waters gen 8 1 cf gen 1 2 division of waters gen 8 1 5 cf gen 1 6 8 appearance of plants gen 8 6 12 cf gen 1 9 13 appearance of light gen 8 13 14 cf gen 1 14 19 deliverance of animals gen 8 15 17 cf gen 1 20 23 animals together with men , blessing , food for men , image of god gen 8 18 9 7 cf gen 1 24 31 sign of covenant gen 9 8 17 cf gen 2 1 3 thus in the over arching literary structure of the re creation in the flood narrative , the universal dimension of the flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of genesis 1 2 iv conclusion in conclusion , the question of the extent of the genesis flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for christian faith for those who see the days of creation in genesis 1 as six , literal 24 hour days \( see hasel 1994 \) , a universal flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column a literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world wide flood but a universal flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and scripture it is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of genesis 1 11 and the rest of scripture \( for a more detailed discussion of the theology of the genesis flood in its canonical context , see davidson in press \) the many links with the universal creation in genesis 1 2 which we have noted in this study not only support the aspect of universality in the flood , but serve to theologically connect protology \( creation \) and eschatology \( judgment salvation \) in the opening chapters of scripture the flood is an eschatological step by step uncreation of the world and humanity followed by a step by step re creation of the new world thus , writes von rad , the story of the flood and this is theologically the most important fact shows an eschatological world judgment the world judgment of the flood hangs like an iron curtain between this world age and that of the first splendor of creation \( von rad 1972 , p 129 130 \) the theology of the universal flood is therefore the pivot of a connected but multi faceted universal theme running through genesis 1 11 and constituting an over arching pattern for the entire subsequent world wide creation revealing the character of the creator and his original purpose for creation humankind 's turning from the creator and the universal spread of sin ending in the universal uncreation through eschatological judgment and re creation , in the eschatological salvation of the faithful covenant remnant and the universal renewal of the earth",evolution,0

i could not , honestly , provide it , and if i were to leave it to artistic licence , would htat not mislead the reader \? i wrote the text of my book four years ago in the book he does talk of his belief in some transitions my dialogue if i were to write it now , i think the book would be rather different gradualism is a concept i believe in , not just because of darwin 's authority , but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it yet famous fossil expert stephen j gould and the american museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitinoal fossils as a palaeontologist myself , i am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record you say that i should at least show a photo of the fossil form which each type of organism was derived i will lay it on teh line there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument patterson came under fire from fellow evolutionists for having made this and similar candid admissinos , and attempted to soften the remarks retrospectively however , the language is clear and unmistakable stephen jay gould , evolutionist said this the lack of transitional fossils is the trade secret of palaeontology all quotes came from the revised quote book you interestingly bring up human evolution human evolution is blank and filled with a tonne of holes that would sink the titanic let us go through the basic evolutionary candidates australopithecines \( lucy fossil type \) dr charles oxnard is one of a growing number of evolutionist anatomists who have examined vast numbers of measurements by computerized multivariate analysis \( an objective method that does not depend on preconceived beliefs about ancestry \) , do not believ that these creatuers are human ancestors he states that although initally it was though that they were human like or at least intermediate between apes and humans , the reality is that they differ more from both humans and african apes than do these two living groups from each other the australopithecines are unique recent cat scans of the bony labyrinth which once housed their organ of balance have shown conclusively that they did not habitually walk upright , as many still insist homo habblis many scientists \( evolutionary scientists included \) are now recognising that habblis is a waste bin of two or more creatures , and hence , is an invalid category even so , the cat scans have determined that habblis was less bipedal than australopithecines so we are actually de evolving if you will homo erectus and neandertals once again , cat scans have shown that erectus and neandertals walked up right just like us they would be able to run , hop , skip , jump , etc , and do all the things that we do today many scientists now classify erectus and neandertals as true humans and it has been known that neandertal types had been living at the same time as modern types tools found on an indonesian island in associatino with stegodon \( an extinct elephant \) remains have cause evolutionist dr alan thorne to suggest that these so called pre human ancestors had seafaring skills and technology as far back as 1993 he said , they 're not i e should n't be called homo erecus , they 're people this quote came from the australian , 19 august 1993 if one uses the evolutionists' own timescales and criteria for classification and plots all hominid fossil discoveries on a chart , it will readily be seen that the idea of any evolutionary sequence is a shambles \( m lubenow , bones of contention \) i found it interesting that you got your information from talkorigins com they totally do not know what they are talking about in one article that i saw regarding snrs they totally changed the scientific evidence to suit their own theory , as for one , the article was not written by an educated person , nor did it have any references unlike the article on snrs that was written by answers in genesis many of their arguments , like the one on your link can be easliy refuted other articles employ what is known as the straw man argument tactic , i e using an argument that can be easily refuted and one that is not held by anyone if evolution is true , than we should expect to find millions and millions of fossils of in between forms , right \? well , the truth is , we do n't some evolutionists claim there are some maybe a handful of such in between fossil types \( highly , highly , highly debatable \) other leading experts have rejected soe or all of these what is not well known is that the interesting fossil creature archaeopteryx , often used as an example of a transitional form between reptiles and birds shows none of the crucial transitinoal structures which would strongly argue for transitional status the feathers are fully formed , and the wings are proper wings it has the backward facing claw and curved feet characteristic of perching birds it wasmost definitely not , as some would reconstruct it , a running feathered dinosaur in fact , the same can be shown to be true for whale evolution animals such as the ambulocetus and the basilosaurs these are not evolutionary transitional forms , as you are often told many evolutionists do not even acknowledge them , but this does not mean that they do n't believe in their theory so in this respect , the fossil record does not show evolution as you are commonly told in fact , it tells us that things breed true to their kind , i e horses produce horses , cats produce cats and so on you than go onto challange",evolution,0

546@3,"the hidden agenda behind gun storage laws by david kopel in canada and great britain deceitful safe storage laws allow government invasion of gun owners` homes these laws are all part of the gun grabbers` wholesale attack on private gun ownership responsible gun owners store their guns safely for over a century , the national rifle association and other civic groups have done everything they can to encourage safe gun storage partly as a result , the fatal gun accident rate for both kids and adults has fallen to an all time low in spite of this , anti gun politicians , and the anti gun groups are working to turn safe storage into a tool for disarming the american public gun owners who think they have nothing to lose from a government takeover of gun storage should look at what has happened in countries such as canada and great britain there , gun owner apathy has allowed safe storage to become the platform for abolishing gun ownership for home protection , for invading the privacy and the homes of gun owners , and for attacking even the simple possession of firearms great britain british gun owners have a long tradition of going along with government proposals for reasonable restrictions on their rights but as many britons found out too late , a restriction that appears reasonable on paper may become quite unreasonable in practice british law merely mandates that guns be stored in a secure place but britain has a national gun licensing system , similar to the american system proposed by sarah brady of handgun control , inc because most police administrators in britain are intensely opposed to citizens owning guns , they use the storage law to make acquiring a gun license as onerous as possible if you want to obtain or renew a gun license in britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system although the law , even today , does not order guns to be locked in a safe , the police routinely compel gun owners to purchase safes sometimes two safes , the second one for separate storage of ammunition a person buying a low powered l5 rimfire rifle may have to spend 100 on a safe a person with five guns may be ordered to add a 1000 electronic security system one effect of the heavy security costs is to reduce the ability of middle income or poor people to legally own guns , a goal which has been a constant objective of gun control proponents throughout history of course , the requirement that guns be locked in safes makes it nearly impossible for the gun to be used for home protection and the british police establishment despises the idea of defensive gun ownership if you want to obtain or renew a gun license in britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system the requirement that gun owners purchase safes was never democratically enacted by the british parliament rather , the requirement was invented by police administrators , who correctly recognized that any system requiring government permission to buy a gun can be manipulated by anti gun administrators \( similarly , in the united states , police administrators have used the brady act to deny handgun purchases by thousands of people with unpaid traffic tickets or other trivial offenses brady does not formally sanction such abuses , but by requiring government permission for handgun purchases , the act makes such abuses inevitable \) canada in canada , the criminal code prohibits careless storage of a firearm , and gives the government the authority to create storage regulations what does this mean in practice \? consider some cases from 1996 and 1997 hearing suspicious sounds , perhaps from a burglar , a husband took his unloaded rifle with him one night when he looked around his house a few days later , the wife told a friend about the incident aghast , the friend called the police the police arrived at the couple`s home and bullied their way in searching the home , they found the unloaded rifle under a mattress in the bedroom no children lived in the home the couple was charged with careless storage of a firearm a 67 year old single woman ran a small boarding house in ontario a downstairs tenant began harassing and stalking her worried that the woman might pose a threat to the tenant , the police searched her apartment and found several unloaded guns in her closets she was convicted of storage of a firearm in violation of government regulations she had been attending school and studying to become a paralegal , but her conviction will bar her from a job in the legal field recently in winnipeg , a 72 year old woman called a hospital to request that a visiting nurse come over and help her with some medication someone from the hospital asked if the woman had any firearms in the home yes , she replied , my husband has a couple of old hunting rifles down in the rec room the police came over immediately and began searching the home they found several long guns , each with a trigger lock and locked to a rack in the basement they also found a 25 caliber pistol locked in a bedroom closet , which they had broken into the 73 year old husband came home in the middle of the search , and was immediately handcuffed , and accused of being violent other than the fact that he owned guns , there was no evidence that he was violent \( his neighbors later signed statements saying they had known him for years , and he had always been peaceful \) eventually the police removed the handcuffs , and told the man that he had never been under arrest gun storage laws sometimes provide a means for police to justify outrageously bad police work in medicine hat , alberta , a criminal who had charges pending against him tried to buy leniency by claiming that a man named larry davies was a marijuana dealer , with over a pound in his house the medicine hat police did nothing to verify the informant`s claim , other than looking up larry davies` address in the phone book the swat team , apparently having nothing else to do that day , broke into the davies household , and forced larry davies and three friends to the floor , pointing submachine guns at their heads a search of the house revealed mrs davies and her newborn baby , who had come home from the hospital that day four grams of marijuana \( weighing less than a united states 25 cent piece \) and a disassembled fn fal rifle in a basement closet apparently embarrassed but not repentant about the sloppy police practices and wanton show of force , the government charged mr davies with unsafe storage of a firearm happily , a judge threw the charges out of court , noting that whatever mr davies had done was much less of a threat to society than what the police had done and canadian courts have sometimes stopped other abusive prosecutions related to gun storage laws but even then , the victim of the abusive prosecution must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees to avoid a prison sentence of up to two years as david tomlinson , president of canada`s national firearms association , points out , gun storage laws are unenforceable without random police searches of the home canada`s newest gun law , which goes into effect next year , gives the police the authority to inspect private homes to ensure that gun storage laws are being complied with gun storage laws are like laws barring married couples from using birth control they are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home in 1965 , the united states supreme court struck down a birth control ban for this very reason \( griswold v connecticut , 381 u s 479 \( 1965 \) \) for the same reason , privacy minded legislators and citizens should reject turning the government into the home gun storage enforcer former president clinton , by the way , effusively praised the new canadian gun law \( bill c 68 \) which authorizes searches without probable cause small steps gun prohibition almost always moves by incremental steps restrictions that would have seemed outrageous if proposed by themselves can appear reasonable when they merely advance existing restrictions a few more steps gun storage laws are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home in canada , prohibitionists , such as then justice minister alan rock , have used gun storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration , since registration will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe storage laws that are in effect as the next step , the anti gun lobbies in canada have begun pushing for community storage rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home , you would have to keep your guns at a police station when you wanted to use your gun for the day , you could check it out from the police station the anti gun groups point out that a gun in the home could be stolen , or could be misused in a domestic incident there is no reason , they argue , for guns to be kept in a home 365 days a year , when the gun may only be used a few days a year to counter the anti gun groups , gun owners in canada can hardly argue that removing guns from the home makes it impossible to use the guns for home defense they gave up the moral case for self defense years ago by arguing that gun ownership was justified for sporting purposes , but not daring to assert that gun ownership is justified for defensive purposes and by agreeing to safe storage laws , the canadian gun owners gave up the practical ability to use a gun for self defense in a sudden emergency with so much ground already conceded , canadian gun owners are reduced to arguing minor points , such as how a centralized gun storage repository might be more vulnerable to theft even conceding on the community storage issue will do gun owners no good in 1996 , the british parliament banned almost all handguns , but allowed owners of single shot 22s to keep the guns locked in central repositories at gun ranges the new restrictions only briefly sated the appetite of the british anti gun lobbies in 1997 , community storage was replaced by its logical consequence , complete prohibition of all handguns the future who can believe that the right to keep and bear arms could survive community storage , with gun owners needing to ask government bureaucrats for permission to obtain access to their own guns \? who can believe that the american anti gun lobbies , who so consistently imitate the programs of their foreign cousins , will not begin demanding community storage , once they have laid the foundation with safe storage laws \? storing guns safely is the duty of every gun owner what makes for safety depends very much on individual circumstances safety is , and always has been , the concern of organizations such as the national rifle association in the hands of anti gun lobbies and government bureaucrats , though , safe storage becomes an orwellian term designed to negate the many safety benefits of the right to bear arms home safety is the responsibility of the family , not

571@0,"change nobody believes in a bill so reckless that it has to be rammed through on a partisan vote on christmas eve mr obama promised a new era of transparent good government , yet on saturday morning mr reid threw out the 2 , 100 page bill that the world 's greatest deliberative body spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new manager 's amendment that was stapled together in covert partisan negotiations democrats are barely even bothering to pretend to care what 's in it , not that any senator had the chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture vote at 1 a m this morning after procedural motions that allow for no amendments , the final vote could come at 9 p m on december 24 even in world war i there was a christmas truce the rushed , secretive way that a bill this destructive and unpopular is being forced on the country shows that reform has devolved into the raw exercise of political power for the single purpose of permanently expanding the american entitlement state an increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted that no one can truly understand it , as finance chairman max baucus admitted on the floor last week the only goal is to ram it into law while the political window is still open , and clean up the mess later 8226 health costs from the outset , the white house 's core claim was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and businesses , and they 're sticking to that story anyone who says otherwise simply has n't read the bills , mr obama said over the weekend this is so utterly disingenuous that we doubt the president really believes it the best and most rigorous cost analysis was recently released by the insurer wellpoint , which mined its actuarial data in various regional markets to model the senate bill wellpoint found that a healthy 25 year old in milwaukee buying coverage on the individual market will see his costs rise by 178 a small business based in richmond with eight employees in average health will see a 23 increase insurance costs for a 40 year old family with two kids living in indianapolis will pay 106 more and on and on these increases are solely the result of obamacare 8212 above and far beyond the status quo 8212 because its strict restrictions on underwriting and risk pooling would distort insurance markets all but a handful of states have rejected regulations like community rating because they encourage younger and healthier buyers to wait until they need expensive care , increasing costs for everyone benefits and pricing will now be determined by politics as for the white house 's line about cutting costs by eliminating supposed waste , even victor fuchs , an eminent economist generally supportive of obamacare , warned last week that these political theories are overly simplistic the oft heard promise 'we will find out what works and what does not' scarcely does justice to the complexity of medical practice , the stanford professor wrote 8226 steep declines in choice and quality this is all of a piece with the hubris of an administration that thinks it can substitute government planning for market forces in determining where the 33 trillion the u s will spend on medicine over the next decade should go this centralized system means above all fewer choices what works for the political class must work for everyone with formerly private insurers converted into public utilities , for instance , they 'll inevitably be banned from selling products like health savings accounts that encourage more cost conscious decisions unnoticed by the press corps , the congressional budget office argued recently that the senate bill would so substantially reduce flexibility in terms of the types , prices , and number of private sellers of health insurance that companies like wellpoint might need to be considered part of the federal budget with so large a chunk of the economy and medical practice itself in washington 's hands , quality will decline ultimately , our capacity to innovate and develop new therapies would suffer most of all , as harvard medical school dean jeffrey flier recently wrote in our pages take the 2 billion annual tax 8212 rising to 3 billion in 2018 8212 that will be leveled against medical device makers , among the most innovative u s industries democrats believe that more advanced health technologies like mri machines and drug coated stents are driving costs too high , though patients and their physicians might disagree the senate is n't hearing those of us who are closest to the patient and work in the system every day , brent eastman , the chairman of the american college of surgeons , said in a statement for his organization and 18 other speciality societies opposing obamacare for no other reason than ideological animus , doctor owned hospitals will face harsh new limits on their growth and who they 're allowed to treat physician hospitals of america says that obamacare will destroy over 200 of america 's best and safest hospitals 8226 blowing up the federal fisc even though medicare 's unfunded liabilities are already about 2 6 times larger than the entire u s economy in 2008 , democrats are crowing that obamacare will cost only 871 billion over the next decade while fantastically reducing the deficit by 132 billion , according to cbo yet some 98 of the total cost comes after 2014 8212 remind us why there must absolutely be a vote this week 8212 and most of the taxes start in 2010 that includes the payroll tax increase for individuals earning more than 200 , 000 that rose to 0 9 from 0 5 percentage points in mr reid 's final machinations job creation , here we come other deceptions include a new entitlement for long term care that starts collecting premiums tomorrow but does n't start paying benefits until late in the decade but the worst is not accounting for a formula that automatically slashes medicare payments to doctors by 21 5 next year and deeper after that everyone knows the payment cuts wo n't happen but they remain in the bill to make the cost look lower the american medical association 's priority was eliminating this sustainable growth rate but all they got in return for their year of obamacare cheerleading was a two month patch snuck into the defense bill that passed over the weekend the truth is that no one really knows how much obamacare will cost because its assumptions on paper are so unrealistic to hide the cost increases created by other parts of the bill and transfer them onto the federal balance sheet , the senate sets up government run exchanges that will subsidize insurance for those earning up to 400 of the poverty level , or 96 , 000 for a family of four in 2016 supposedly they would only be offered to those whose employers do n't provide insurance or work for small businesses as eugene steuerle of the left leaning urban institute points out , this system would treat two workers with the same total compensation 8212 whatever the mix of cash wages and benefits 8212 very differently under the senate bill , someone who

610@1,"evolution theory is not science at all , it is faith period how can i conclude that \? because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias ideology godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory","well , now , here 's the thing a hypothesis of special creation of all things \( such as is described in the bible \) is inconsistent with the evidence we can elicit from living things today for instance , there 's the amount of non functional dna we share with other creatures , in particular the other apes with shared functional dna , now , one could make a case for economy of design , but deliberately putting the same broken genes and garbage dna into two entirely seperate species \? then there 's the fact that some creatures have far better 'designed' bits than others for no readily apparent reason a good example is the octopus eye , whose retina is supplied with blood from the rear rather than the front , both anchoring the retina more securely \( no detached retina problems \) and avoiding the 'blind spot' mammalian eyes possess there 's no reason at all for a designer capable of making an octupus to use the inferior mammalian design then there 's the issue of vestigial features vestigial does n't necessarily mean 'useless' , more properly it describes something that is 'overengineered' for the purpose it currently serves , and often looks very much like a crippled version of a feature possessed by some other species ostrich wings , for example , may be useful for balancing when running , or in mating rituals , but they do n't need to be wings in order to serve those purposes their complex and delicate internal structure is clearly 'designed' to allow flight , but their stunted development and the practical impossibility of such a big bird achieving self powered flight make them a vestigial structure again , what rationale can be made for this being the work of a designer \? then there 's the fossil record try as one might to twist the evidence to fit a biblical flood , it just wo n't go paleontologists have found spider tracks sandwiched in sandstone layers imagine , if you can , the delicate impressions of a spider 's footsteps surviving a deluge sufficient to suspend and deposit yards and yards of sand atop them hydrodynamic sorting of fossils , or burial order , does n't fit either , since it requires that we pretend all dinosaurs were large and slow moving \( they were n't \) and that all mammals are small , agile and fast moving \( they are n't \) on and on it goes if we take evolution off the table completely and look at the evidence before us , we have no explanation that fits special creation simply does n't add up with all creation myths falsified , what are we supposed to do \? just pretend the history of life on earth does n't matter , or should be ignored \? evolution is n't what you come up with when you apply atheist thinking evolution is what you come up with when you discount all the extant hypotheses that do n't fit the facts , be they religiously inspired or otherwise now , you may hold your hand up and complain that we 're not admitting the possibility of some kind of divine guiding hand steering or helping evolution and that 's fair enough we generally do n't , for two different reasons first , it does n't really add anything to the theory it does n't increase its power to explain what we see so while you can of course choose to believe that 's what 's happening , it does n't have any scientific value secondly , there 's arguably some merit in the attitude that religion has had its chance and blown it for thousands of years religions have claimed to bear upon their backs the infallible word of god now , if the bible had been saying all along centuries before the technology existed to verify it that god coaxed organisms into evolving from simpler organisms over millions of years , that would be compelling evidence that the bible was accurate and divinely inspired , since it would contain accurate predictions \( which no man could have made \) about what we should find when we look into our dna or beneath the ground but it does n't make those predictions so why should we now pay attention when intelligent design evangelists do a 6000 year too late handbrake turn and invent a new faith based explanation for the evidence \? after all , they have no divine mandate to do so it 's the bible that 's supposedly the word of god they 're just making stuff up as they go along",evolution,0

615@2,"\( cnn \) drug traffickers are planting millions of marijuana plants on u s public lands ever closer to tourist sites , guarding their plots with heavy weaponry , federal authorities say we destroy their plants and they come back , sometimes to the same spot , and replant , said u s forest service special agent russ arthur it 's definitely possible that hikers and campers are going to find themselves in the middle of a field facing some very dangerous , armed bad guys , because this problem is everywhere , and it 's only getting worse across the nation , pot sites linked to cartels have been found in 15 states as far north as washington , arthur said last week , a portion of sequoia national park in the sierra nevada was closed to visitors while rangers dropped from helicopters into a marijuana farm a half mile away from crystal cave , popular among tourists officials said there were five sites in the yucca creek canyon where investigators recovered tons of trash , netting , chemicals and camping materials , a discovery that suggested the growers had been there , or planned to stay , for a long time though authorities destroyed the patch , whoever wanted to profit probably got what they wanted seventy five percent of the plants had been harvested , said park spokeswoman adrienne freeman last week for six days , instead of having families and children walking down to crystal cave , we were flying helicopters to do a law enforcement operation , she said that 's not fair you should be able to come to the park and enjoy it freeman cautioned that there is a steep cliff near the site and most visitors would n't be skilled enough to trek into the area but some might in idaho earlier this summer , hikers came upon 12 , 545 marijuana plants valued at 6 3 million , officials said this week , the national park service was working to eradicate plants at indiana dunes national lakeshore , beloved by fishermen , where one year ago the agency brought out six dump trucks full of marijuana 10 , 000 plants valued at 8 5 million , according to chief ranger mike bremer and on friday , the drug enforcement administration said it had found 14 , 500 marijuana plants growing in a patch of forest land 40 miles southwest of denver , colorado , where campers have ventured the forest service has stepped up its efforts to raid forest areas in georgia and tennessee , including areas near the chattahoochee river , a favorite among hikers , campers and adventure racers the agency has started podcasting and posting signs on public land , trying to describe to regular folks what a pot field looks like and how to get away from it quickly though traffickers have been planting on public lands for years , figures from the u s forest service indicate the sheer volume of marijuana plants on public land has increased every year since 2005 by millions and those are just the plants that the government knows about and has destroyed most pot farms are cultivated by low level cartel workers , many who are working to pay off smugglers who helped them cross the border , officials have said campsites are sophisticated and well hidden , with foxholes and sniper nests , arthur told cnn the workers plant four to five farms at a time to get one bountiful crop , reckoning that two might be destroyed by law enforcement , one might fail because of weather , and another could be pilfered by what officers call pot pirates , americans who risk getting close to traffickers to score free pot , arthur said dean growdon , an assistant sheriff and commander of the lassen county , california , narcotics task force , said he 's especially concerned about pot farm violence now because hunting season is about to start we get more reports this time of year from hunters who 've stumbled onto sites , he said we had a guy who discovered they were growing on the back portion of his property the sheriff 's department knows firsthand of the dangers two deputies are still recovering from being shot in june when they stumbled on a pot field , sheriff steven warren said in the encounter , one of the deputies shot and killed a grower , warren said , and the surviving growers are being prosecuted , he said our guys saw the field and were trying to make their way back to get help when they ran into the growers there were two suspected growers laying back on a rock and when our guys saw them , there was a moment when everyone just froze , said warren there was a guy in a tent that had an ak 47 and our guys have a gun on him to me , that grower , he was on a suicide mission he could have never believed he would live through that , the sheriff said although federal agents have stepped up raids on sites across the country , arrests are tough to make because growers know the terrain like the backs of their hands when authorities surprise them by dropping into their camps , growers dart off to hiding places or through the thick woods , making foot chases difficult in july , a multi agency sting in california 's fresno county the largest ever nationwide netted 420 , 000 plants , worth 1 6 billion , and the arrests of 100 people as many as 82 mexican nationals were taken into custody and deported , the fresno county state attorney 's office told cnn so far , the u s attorney 's office has charged 16 people if convicted , those without prior drug charges would face 10 years to life and a 4 million fine those with drug records could get double that sentence but little intelligence is gleaned from growers they do n't want to talk , fearful of the consequences their families could face back in mexico it 's still mostly a mystery how growers keep their camps going , how they transport their food , and where and how they move their finished product it 's also mostly unclear how they are managing to carry so much equipment piping , chemicals and basic living necessities into the deep woods but it 's clear they are causing expensive and irreversible damage to the ecosystem growers often dam up natural waterways with pvc pipe to redirect water to their plants , or poison the land and animals with insecticides many poach for food tons of trash is found scattered on the sites in sequoia national park , 1 million has been spent since 2006 on marijuana plantation cleanup alone , and the damage done to crystal cave will be felt for years to come , said the park spokeswoman , adrienne freeman we are continually discovering new species in that cave , and we are letting mexican cartels threaten to wipe that out , she said","our national parks are safe as is , huh \? regular people have no reason to feel to need to carry concealed weapons for their own protection , huh \? how can you be safe when mexican

648@1,"the one with the common law but since you do n't have common sense , you probably never hoid of it ignorance of a contract 's obvious terms is never an excuse from being bound by them , once one consents to those legal and binding terms via accepting consideration \( i e engaging in sexual congress as you put it \) and if men think that sexual intercourse with a fertile woman does n't involve the risk of pregnancy , they 're inexcusably ignorant like you this creates an implied in fact contract between the the man and the woman , with the party conceived being beneficiary and subject thereto \( i e parental rights over the child etc \) those are the clear and obvious terms , and therefore sexual intercourse is a contingency agreement between the couple doing the coupling , and any potential offspring resulting therefrom if they do n't like the terms , they can act to reduce the chances , or avoid the contract entirely through simply abstaining from the agreemetn but they ca n't pact for the wrongful death of the unwitting third party , in order for their own personal benefit at that child 's expense freedom is not carte blanche to do as one pleases , but only in a manner exclusive of the rights of others and so social contracts are not not strictly about what you want , it 's about what you consent to whether by your actions or words consistent with those rights of everyone , whether pre or post natal a woman 's body is not another country , let alone another universe the price of freedom is n't eternal vigilance it 's responsibility to others , for what you choose do with that freedom","though i am jumping into the discussion here and have not followed it from the beginning , i need to address yours points i get the impression that you view women as having a responsibility over their offspring from the point of conception on i e not only in late term i would contest this up to around the beginning of the third trimester , the embryo fetus is nothing but a developing body with nobody home i e no mental existence \( no thoughts , no emotions , no sense of self , no feelings of pain , no ability to experience their environment nothing \) i do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body as at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness , it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive it is the person who effectively resides in the body \( through mental brain function or belief in a soul \) who we value not the body itself from discussions with those on the pro life side , it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo early fetus is not as much what it currently is but what it will become what it currently is is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something someone that we do value the hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions , thoughts , feelings of pain , etc apparently , its value dropped significantly \( at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question \) however , once there is somebody home in that body , then i would agree that you now have another person whose rights should be taken into account biologically , neurologically speaking , such mental functions ca n't start before around the beginning of the third trimester so , i support more clearly legally restricting third trimester abortion rights to the limited exceptions \( mother 's life , significant risk to health , mercy killing deformed fetuses , etc \) then it makes sense to speak of an other to whom one has responsibilities one last point i have heard a few pro life advocates make the same arguement you do that pro choice supporters make their arguements simply out of a defense rationalization , where you think they really do agree that they are doing wrong you do n't realize that they actually generally do believe all of what they say as a general rule of thumb , i tend to think that most people believe what they say however , many people have holes or inconsistencies in their thinking that one can highlight if one can tell what those holes or inconsistencies are i have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer where the pro life camp is concerned , i find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo early fetus is at that moment , independent of what it will become in the future this has highlighted that it is only valued by what it will become , not for what it currently is as for the extreme pro choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason \( note they represent a minority of the pro choice side \) , then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth minus one day abortion for any reason so , instead of jumping to wrong assumptions about the reasoning of pro choice supporters , search for holes in logic and reasoning that you can exploit that would be far more effective than your false assumptions that they are harboring guilt",abortion,0

691@1,"i find it interesting that the slippery slope fallacy keeps popping up again and again in the arguments of pro gun activists even after the heller decision in that decision , the supreme court recognized an individual right to own guns but rejected the slippery slope argument that has been used by the gun lobby for years i also find it hard to believe some of what gets posted in favor of the slippery slope argument such as claims that sarah brady wants all guns to be banned which are contradicted by quotes by her in credible online sources and also such statistics as i t is estimated that there are between 22 , 000 and 30 , 000 gun laws on the books in america which have little basis in fact the belief that there are approximately 20 , 000 gun control laws in the united states has become received wisdom but as it turns out , there appears to be little basis for the number since the early 1980s , the national rifle association has mounted a very successful campaign to encourage state governments to enact 'preemption' laws , forbidding local governments from enacting their own gun laws today , more than 40 states preempt all or most local gun control laws , which has likely reduced the overall number of local gun laws clearly the 20 , 000 figure is more a product of advocacy than science and however it was initially derived , the trend toward preemption of local laws has substantially reduced the total the most informative answer to the question of 'how many gun control laws \? ' is then 'about 300 major state and federal laws , and an unknown but shrinking number of local laws ' http www brookings edu es urban pu s gunbook4 pdf so why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a supreme court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality , a decline in the number of gun laws , and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns \? could it be that pro gun extremists find it necessary to resort to the slippery slope fallacy because they find it otherwise difficult to make a convincing argument against reasonable and common sense gun laws aimed at protecting law abiding citizens from gun violence and the misuse of firearms \?","from your source which indeed does have its own slippery slope built in another problem with estimating the number of gun laws is agreeing on a definition of just what is to be included for example , many local laws prohibit carrying or firing guns in public places inclusion of such laws would certainly inflate national estimates of the number of gun laws and here comes tada one of the slippery slopes but if one considers only laws that control the manufacture , design , sale , purchase , or possession of gunsthe cluster of laws many probably imagine as constituting gun control lawsthe number of local laws will be much smaller with most gun laws containing numerous , interrelated subparts , there is also no clear rule for defining what should count as a separate law and yet another in short , no matter how the 20 , 000 gun law figure was initially derived , the overwhelming trend toward preemption of local laws is likely to have substantially reduced the total even a very liberal interpretation of what should count as a separate law would leave the total well short of 20 , 000 yea right ! in our view , the discovery that there may be as few as 300 major statewide laws that fit our definition of a gun control statute \( with some states having as few as one or two such laws \) yields a far more appropriate figure for public policy discussion in other words we do n't really have a clue here but we 'll call it short so we win nice try though",gun control,0

well in our discussions it seems to boil down to four areas first , fear of federal government intrusion into our lives every time i look at or listen to the news , there is something new and intrusive coming out of the obama administration and this congress new tax schemes , government run canadian style healthcare , a volunteer citizen defense force \( whatever that is , what happened to the national guard \? \) equipped with funding similar to our military , forced voluntary service after retirement , a lack of a southern border with hordes of illegal and criminal aliens pouring over our border , the swine flu scare as well as government forced closing of thousands of privately held chrysler and gm dealerships , which will be the final nail in the coffin for these companies and the list goes on and on but these items in the news are just the tip of the iceberg we cant see the full impact of these actions yet , but we dont know what was added into the thousand of pages of stimulus package bills in the dead of night yet i predict however that when the plans contained in the stimulus packages go into effect , a lot of us are going to be surprised if not shocked by what has suddenly and sweepingly changed what also scares us is the second , well founded fear that there is an assault weapons ban looming , one that would make the clinton ban appear like a look of disdain in comparison i remember well the 1990s and the clinton years the rise of militia groups , the black helicopter rumors and paranoia , all of which was motivated by the brady law and the assault weapons ban what if a new ban comes requiring registration or confiscation and turn in of banned weapons as what happened in australia \? i foresee much civil disobedience coming down the road americans are citizens , and not subjects like the british , canadians or australians they just dont always obey the law blindly and not one officer or citizen that i spoke to said anything like i hope i get to keep this gun for awhile before they are banned they are fun to shoot , so i would hate to give it up it isnt going to happen , so the cop on the street and the soldier on the base needs to think now what he will do if the orders come down i think you all get what i am saying here which leads me to the third fear , that there is a revolution coming , yes , a revolution on the scale of the original american revolution you can hear this topic discussed on many of the talk radio shows by even the big name hosts the possibility of an armed revolution against the u s government being discussed , albeit very gingerly and fleetingly and as something to be avoided , which it is i never heard this mentioned in the 90s one of my quietest , low profile officer friends brought it up the other day he said that at some point in the near future , he felt there is going to be an armed revolt if things keep going the way they are something has got to give i was shocked yes , i had heard this from some of my more radical cop friends in the past , but to hear it from a guy like this was unprecedented now , these guys are not saying this will happen to foment revolution , preach sedition or to even participate they just want to be ready if it happens , to at least defend their families , because number four on the fear list is general societal chaos cops fear for their parents , wives , children or grandchildren more now than ever before most cops are encouraging their spouses and loved ones to get concealed carry permits not only that , but some of these same cops are buying gun mounts for their personal cars so they can carry an ar in the family ride at the ready all the time they are also strapping on heavier forms of off duty hardware i have other friends that are issued ars or subguns for tactical team use , who always have their gear with them and are planning on just commandeering these weapons for personal use in defending hearth and home final notes this is pretty heady and maybe even dangerous stuff know fully that i am not advocating anything here i am reflecting to you what i see and hear going on around me , and maybe saying things that havent been said in the open , until now it is something to think about","to our fellow americans on the left think carefully before you overplay your cards ! but what do i know i am just a dumb hillbilly pickup driving , dumb bunny !",gun control,1

no ! the woman with mental health problems is far more likely to experience post abortion emotional and psychological problems than a more stable woman four classic references here are these women with a history of psychiatric disturbance were three times as likely to have some psychiatric disturbance after an abortion as others who had no such history e greenglass , abortion amp psychiatric disturbance , canadian psych assn jour , vol 21 , no 7 , nov 1976 , pp 453 459 dr charles ford and his associates at ucla reported the same finding the more serious the psychiatric diagnosis , the less beneficial was the abortion c ford et al , abortion , is it a therapeutic procedure in psychiatry \? jama , vol 218 , no 8 , nov 22 , 1971 , pp 1173 1178 the more severely ill the psychiatric patient , the worse is her post abortion psychiatric state e sandberg , psychology of abortion in comprehensive handbook of psychiatry , 3rd ed kaplan amp friedman publishers , 1980 all of these support the original official statement of the world health organization in 1970 serious mental disorders arise more often in women with previous mental problems thus , the very women for whom legal abortion is considered justified on psychiatric grounds are the ones who have the highest risk of post abortion psychiatric disorders then mental illness as a reason for abortion is just an excuse \? precisely what about psychological problems after abortion \? when your authors wrote handbook on abortion in 1971 , there were a few murmurings about post abortion problems , but little was known we then saw the negatives as mostly physical when we wrote abortion questions amp answers in 1985 , physical damage , while still a major problem , was given less emphasis , and negative psychological aftermath was being seriously investigated with the publication of this book , far more is known about what is now called post abortion syndrome which clearly is a post traumatic stress syndrome a post traumatic stress syndrome \? yes this type of problem was first seen in large numbers in vietnam veterans , but did not manifest it self until a decade after they returned the same ten year delay has been evident with abortion t keane , vietnam vets trauma disorder level at 15 , am med news , l abraham , dec 2 , 1988 , p 2 what is post abortion syndrome \( pas \) \? many women are very ambivalent about getting aborted but do go ahead those around her told her \( and she told herself \) that it wouldnt bother her when symptoms occur , she tells herself it cant be the abortion causing them , and then into play come her two major psychological defense mechanisms repression and denial for some this works successfully for others it shades off to manageable distress , to severe and life changing upset and even to suicide there is a delay \? yes ! her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief then , with repression and denial , she avoids the problem , usually for years 5 years is common , 10 or 20 not unusual but then , for some , the negative feelings bubble up and break through often the precipitating event is she has a baby , or a close friend or relative has a baby that she has close contact with she finds out she is sterile , or other life changing events what are the symptoms of pas \? guilt is ever present in many guises , along with regret , remorse , shame , lowered self esteem , insomnia , dreams and nightmares , flash backs , anniversary reactions there often is hostility , and even hatred , toward men this can include her husband , and she may be come sexually dysfunctional crying , despair and depression are usual , even at times with suicide attempts recourse to alcohol or drugs to mask the pain is frequent , sometimes leading to sexual promiscuity there is also a numbing and coldness in place of more normal warmth and maternal tenderness is this due to religious guilt feelings \? perhaps in some it is a factor , but most women re ported on in the early studies were unchurched at the time perhaps they had seen pictures of fetuses \? again , not most most did not know it was a baby when they aborted but ive heard that the american psychological association says that pas doesnt exist this group has been strongly pro abortion , and this definitely colors its thinking but during the past decade or more , there have been dozens of national conferences on pas there are many professional articles and about 15 books adding more and more authentication to its existence and knowledge about it further , every one of the almost 4 , 000 pro life pregnancy help centers in the u s now has found that an increasing percentage of their time is now devoted to treating pas women but so many studies deny pas true , and most are invalid for two reasons \( 1 \) timing most studies have investigated feelings for only a few weeks or months post abortion when she is still feeling relief that her problem is gone since the delay before pas symptoms intrude is often 5 years or more , these studies are invalid \( 2 \) superficiality her repression and denial push this deep into her subconsciousness if the survey is done by questionnaire or single interview , she routinely denies problems these studies are invalid only by lengthy psychological testing and counseling can she often admit to some symptoms , much less tie them to the abortion she so desperately wants to forget you mean most studies miss pas \? but most polls show few emotional problems only a sense of relief ! yes , but what women really feel at the deepest level about abortion is very different from what they say in reply to questionnaires a canadian study polled a group of women who had previously completed a questionnaire in which they denied having problems from an abortion one half of this group was randomly chosen for in depth psychotherapy what emerged from psychotherapy was in sharp contrast to the questionnaires , even when the woman had rationally considered abortion to be inevitable , the only course of action it was demonstrated that the conscious , rationalized decision for an abortion can co exist with profound rejection of it at the deepest level despite surface appearances , abortion leaves behind deeper feelings invariably of intense pain , involving bereavement and a sense of identification with the foetus i kent et al , emotional sequelae of elective abortion , british college of med jour , vol 20 , no 4 , april 1978 i kent , abortion has profound impact , family practice news , june 1980 , p 80 are there valid studies \? yes , and two meta analyses james rogers , who carefully examined over 400 published studies , pointed to the almost universal use of poor methodology and research design and grossly substandard power characteristics he concluded that the question of psychological sequelae of abortion is not closed j rogers et al , validity of existing controlled studies examining the psychological sequelae of abortion , perspectives on science and christian faith , vol 39 , no 1 , mar 1987 , pp 20 29 49 another concurred that existing research is methodologically flawed and that women who abort show more negative outcomes than those who deliver their babies e posavac et al , some problems psychological effects of abortion , psychology amp health , 5 , 13 23 how about specific studies \?

suicide is rare among pregnant women , but much more common after induced abortion it is never re ported under maternal mortality from abortion , of course , even though it is causative the suicide rate after an abortion was three times the general suicide rate and six times that associated with birth the rate for women following a live birth was 5 9 per 100 , 000 following miscarriage 18 1 following abortion 34 7 they note that women frequently get short term post natal blues after having a baby , but that this rarely translates into suicide , and that the initial stress of having a child is transitional , the over all effect having a positive effect on womens health m gissler , abortion suicide link , br med j , dec 6 , 1996 then it is rare among pregnant women \?

in the above book your authors also give the findings of suiciders anonymous , and that suicide post abortion is several times more common than post delivery british medical jour , 1996 what of psychosis afterwards \?

in some cases a definite survivor syndrome has been demonstrated children usually know that mother is pregnant they also know when she gets unpregnant this may cause survivors syndrome , similar to that of jews who survived the holocaust it is an irrational but real guilt at why was i saved and why were they killed dr ney has written about this dr edward sheridan of georgetown university has observed also a fear and mistrust of the mother originally , a small child , sensing a siblings arrival , doesnt welcome it when the baby suddenly disappears , the frightened child may get a warped sense of his own power to will people away or , if he knows that his mother was an active agent in doing away with the sibling , he begins to fear her a simple explanation of this was published in l bond , the surviving sibling , natl rtl news , sept 25 , 1986 it is also closely associated with child abuse dr phillip ney , professor of psychiatry at the university of christ church , new zealand , and of later at the university of calgary , canada , while still at the university of british columbia , published a widely read study of this his analysis clearly pointed to the fact that abortion \( and its acceptance of the violence of killing the unborn \) lowered a parents psychic resistance to violence and abuse of the born p ney , relationship between abortion amp child abuse , canada jour psychiatry , vol 24 , 1979 , pp 610 620 is there treatment for pas \? yes , but it is not easy we first must note that only a few doctors are sensitized to the necessary dynamics of treatment specifically , most psychiatrists and psychologists arent much help , nor are psychotropic drugs this requires a gradual healing process , and during it she must have ongoing close emotional support from one or several people who do not have to be trained professionals as of the late 1990s , the place to start is your pro life pregnancy help center they can either work with her themselves and or will know who can basically , there are five steps to the healing process \( 1 \) counter the denial bring this back into her consciousness and admit she was a party to killing her own baby she must grieve over her lost child tears , mourning as for another loved one \( 3 \) seek divine forgiveness this was not expected but seems essential for almost every woman \( 4 \) forgive others difficult , again , but some of this is needed to complete the healing and get rid of her long repressed anger \( 5 \) forgive herself not many get this far , but those who do have real inner peace what is absolutely crucial at every step in the above is compassionate empathy , support and understanding from one or more persons around her j willke , p a s five steps on how you can help , life issues connector , mar 1996post abortion syndrome index page",abortion,0

the uvva creates a federal law making it a crime to cause harm to a child in utero , recognizing everything from a zygote to a fetus as an independent victim , with legal rights distinct from the woman who has been attacked more than 30 states already have similar laws on the books in practice , these laws treat the pregnant woman as little more than collateral damage in an attack portrayed to the public as one directed against the fetus see , this law has nothing to do with prosecuting criminals who attack pregnant woman , it is about turning pregnant women into criminals why do i say that \? lynn m paltrow , executive director of national advocates for pregnant women sums it up quite well in 1984 , south carolina 's supreme court created a state feticide law in a case where a man viciously stabbed his pregnant girlfriend , causing her , among other things , to lose her pregnancy in 1997 , south carolina used this law against a pregnant woman , cornelia whitner , who was charged with failing to provide proper medical care for her unborn child whitner had given birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for an illegal drug based on extrapolation of the state feticide law , ms whitner was convicted of criminal child abuse at sentencing ms whitner begged for drug treatment the judge responded , i think i 'll just let her go to jail regina mcknight was an indigent 22 year old woman with a drug problem she became pregnant and despite her problems had every hope of carrying her pregnancy to term , but the pregnancy ended in stillbirth the hospital reacted not by offering her counseling or drug treatment , but rather by helping build a criminal case against her eventually she was convicted of murder the south carolina medical association and other leading health groups concluded that there was no evidence that mcknight 's drug use caused the stillbirth moreover , no one in this case , not even the prosecution , believed that mcknight had any intention of harming the fetus or losing the pregnancy had mcknight intentionally sought to end her pregnancy by having an illegal third trimester abortion , her sentence would have been two years in jail but because of a law similar to the bill president bush just signed , she is today serving a 12 year sentence read more here another good article on the matter do pregnant woman have rights \? in 1984 , for example , a nigerian woman pregnant and hospitalized in chicago was forced to have a c section she refused the surgery because she planned to return to nigeria where she would be unable to access c sections for future births the hospital obtained a court order and forced her to undergo the procedure hospital staff tied her down with leather wrist and ankle cuffs while she screamed for help another hospital obtained a court order to force a pregnant woman to undergo a blood transfusion doctors yelled at and forcibly restrained , overpowered and sedated the woman in order to carry out the order in washington , dc , doctors sought a court order to force ayesha madyun to have a c section the doctors asserted that the fetus faced a 50 75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically the court , apparently viewing the pregnant woman as having no more rights than a slab of meat , said , a ll that stood between the madyun fetus and its independent existence , separate from its mother , was put simply , a doctor 's scalpel with that , the court granted the order and the scalpel sliced through ms madyun 's flesh , the muscles of her abdominal wall , and her uterus when the procedure was done , there was no evidence of infection angela carder at 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant became critically ill she , her family and her attending physicians all agreed on treatment designed to keep her alive for as long as possible the hospital however called an emergency hearing to determine the rights of the fetus despite testimony that a cesarean section could kill ms carder , the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal rights as a result , ms carder not only lost her right to informed consent and bodily integrity she lost her life the surgery resulted in the death of both angela and her fetus all of these women were denied the right to bodily integrity and physical liberty and their fetuses were granted more rights than any legal person under law that line just about sums it up these laws are n't about saving the unborn , and neither is the pro life movement it is about controlling and punishing pregnant woman it is about taking rights away from the woman the moment of conception as if she no longer exists these people would not think twice about prosecuting a pregnant woman whos pregnancy results in misscarriage intentional , accidental , whatever",abortion,0

asked blair hagen , president of the national firearms association if the rcmp made the mistake in the first place , that has some very serious ramifications in march , the rcmp sent letters to owners of the norinco type 97a rifles , demanding they turn in the guns this came after the rcmp decided the gun was prohibited after determining it could be easily converted to fully automatic fire it was a purpose built fully automatic firearm with the fully automatic features disabled by norinco which were not reported to us , cheliak said it is very easily converted back to automatic automatic weapons , even those converted to semi automatic fire , are prohibited in canada guns that can be easily converted to fully automatic fire are also prohibited the firearms association believes the gun was illegally reclassified , and some members plan to go to court to fight the seizures the nfa is very concerned about the rcmp 's unilateral reclassification of this particular firearm and believes there should be a more transparent process in place to explain it , hagen said apparently , they 've done a report on this however , they 've refused to release that report i think what 's required here is some transparency they should demonstrate that to the owners and to the firearms community , so that everyone knows the truth and we can make a determination if the classification was indeed legitimate cheliak suggested the process is transparent enough why would we , the rcmp , or any police service give out information to any group 8230 on how to convert a firearm from semi automatic to fully automatic \? that 's ludicrous hagen said owners are simply looking for proof he does not believe that if owners knew how to convert their weapons to fully automatic they would do so that quest for proof will be part of the owners' fight in court , where they are questioning the rcmp 's ability to reclassify the weapons hagen said his understanding of the law is that only the federal cabinet can initiate a reclassification however , cheliak said he does n't believe the weapon has actually been reclassified , but classified for the first time a proper classification was done with the physical inspection of the firearm collection of the weapons began in early may the rcmp say about half of the rifles have been turned in those who turned over their weapons were eligible for reimbursement from the ministry of public safety , which is rare public safety minister vic toews issued a written statement supporting the rcmp 's efforts to retrieve the firearms and saying the authorization of compensation balances the need for public safety with the legitimate expectations of firearms owners hagen , of the national firearms association , says the rcmp have put the conservative government , a longtime supporter of the rights of gun owners , in an awkward position for now , the owners do n't feel the government has turned its back on them however , as this issue progresses , it is going to raise a lot of questions with the minister and inside the government , and i think the minister needs to be prepared for that","so it 's just as we 've said registration can and does lead to confiscation down the line and now we have further proof that we 're right about what we say government gets the weapon registered , then they can , at any time and for any reason , demand it be surrendered to the authorities or else punishment will be administered",gun control,1

843@1,"i \( before reading this , please know that i make no value judgements on abortion from my perspective , it is not right or wrong or good or bad it is what it is , regardless of how it is perceived or labeled if you think it 's acceptable as the 'right to choose' good for you ! if you abhor it as 'murdering innocent children' good for you ! i am posting this information because it is something that i discovered recently while investigating various methods of birth control and i believe that many people are not aware of the information i communicate here i was n't take it for whatever it 's worth if the issue is important to you for any reason , i encourage you to do some research on the subject \) the answer depends on the definition of 'abortion ' according to currently accepted medical terms , 'pregnancy' does not begin until the point of implantation of the embryo in the uterine wall and 'abortion' is the termination of a pregnancy so , according to the currently accepted medical terminology , the answer is no , of course not ! however , if you define 'abortion' as the termination of a physical entity that has been developing since the point of fertilization , then there is significant evidence to suggest that the answer is yes and absolutely no evidence to suggest that the answer is no the birth control pill has three primary functions \( as do most hormonal bc agents \) 1 the primary function of the pill is to prevent ovulation , but sometimes ovulation occurs while on the pill 2 a secondary function of the pill is to slow sperm down so that they do not reach the ovum in order to fertilize it , but sometimes the sperm does reach the ovum in time to fertilize it 3 the third function of birth control pills is to create a less hospitable environment for a fertilized egg to implant in the uterus , but sometimes the fertilized egg does implant in the uterine wall , as evidenced by a 'failure rate' when women are on the pill \( in other words , sometimes women get pregnant while on the pill , indicating that all three functions of the pill failed \) it is widely recognized by pill manufacturers and within the medical scientific community that the effects of the pill can and sometimes do arrest the development of a human embryo that has not yet implanted itself into the uterine wall by 'creating a less hospitable environment for the embryo ' how often this happens is uncertain \( some estimates are as high as 50 while some estimates suggest percentages in the low single digits \) , but there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it can and does happen your physician may or may not be aware of this ask her him if you are concerned your physician also may assert that birth control pills do not cause 'abortions' because according to accepted medical terminology , pregnancy does n't begin until implantation while i do not personally believe abortion is 'wrong , ' some people do believe it is wrong if you do believe that abortion \( as in terminating the development of an entity after conception \) then you may logically also have to believe that using the pill for birth control is wrong as it may lead to an abortion prior to implantation hope this is helpful information ! the bootfitter","i know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill , and they happen to get pregnant anyways , it will cause you to miscarry \( not always , but sometimes \) usually it happens very early in the pregnancy before they realize they are even pregnant but i do n't know if i would call that abortion as in the way the term is normally used , because the woman is n't terminating the pregnancy on purpose , although miscarriage is called 'spontanious abortion' i also remember hearing from a friend of mine , who is catholic , that in her church any type of birth control is considered wrong i'm not sure on that though , since i'm not catholic myself",abortion,1

847@2,"licensing systems are very expensive to administer canada 's experience with its full licensing and registration system , begun in december 1998 , is not encouraging the government originally estimated that the cost of licensing canada 's three million gun owners and registering their seven million guns would be 185 million canadian over five years including a one time start up cost of 85 million canadian but , by march 2000 the canadian firearms centre admitted that the system had already cost canadian taxpayers 327 million canadian and was running up an annual bill nearly 10 times higher than the government 's original forecast the march announcement also revealed that although 270 , 000 valid licenses existed from the country 's earlier gun control system , only 142 , 000 new licenses had been issued using these figures as a baseline for america 's arsenal of 65 million handguns , the estimated cost of such a system here is staggering most importantly , licensing and registration in america would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence , such as unintentional gunshot deaths , suicides and the majority of homicides , since most homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other and who purchase guns legally from a political perspective , a battle over licensing and registration brings every gun owner into the fray the nra argument that licensing and registration is the first step towards gun confiscation has always been very persuasive with gun owners in contrast , health and safety regulation of the industry focuses on the conduct of firearm manufacturers advocates of licensing and registration often cite automobiles as an example of the value of licensing and registration we register automobiles and license drivers , so why not guns \? however , licensing and registrationthe primary purpose of which was to enforce a system of taxationhad virtually no effect on automobile death and injury it was not until the national highway traffic and safety administration was established in the 1960s , and changes were forced in automobile design and the driving environment , that decreases were seen","canada 's registry has had horrific problems , only registering 3 4ths of their 7 million guns , and has been hacked more times than lizzie borden 's parents ! or george washington 's cherry tree for those who do n't know the tale of ms borden ! canada gun owners pressuring conservatives",gun control,1

1044@6,"city hall 8211 speaker christine c quinn , together with council member al vann , today announced legislation that would increase penalties for selling a toy gun by 500 percent the legislation would also enhance the department of consumer affairs 8217 enforcement ability and allow the agency to shut stores that are repeat offenders of the law department of consumer affairs \( dca \) commissioner jonathan mintz and criminal justice coordinator john feinblatt joined the speaker and council members at the announcement the officials also announced a new citywide public awareness campaign about the dangers of toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys 8220 despite the fact that new york city 8217 s toy and imitation gun law has been in existence for several years many merchants continue to sell items that resemble real guns , 8221 said council speaker quinn 8220 our communities are at risk when they cannot tell a fake toy gun from a real one and the dangers these items present are all too real children have been hurt and even killed as a result of these guns being out in our communities 8221 the city council 8217 s consumer affairs committee will hold a hearing on the legislation this afternoon the proposed bill would increase the fine for a first violation from 1 , 000 to up to 5 , 000 it would also increase the fines for subsequent violations within a two year period from 3 , 000 to up to 8 , 000 finally , it would also permit dca to seal , for up to five days , the premises of a store found guilty of three or more violations within a two year period current law imposes a fine of up to 1 , 000 but does not increase that amount for subsequent violations since 2002 , dca has removed more than 7 , 200 imitation guns from the shelves of nearly 240 stores throughout the city and levied 2 4 million in fines today , the city also announced a new subway advertising campaign , to be displayed in 2 , 100 subway cars , all 468 subway stations and more than 5 , 400 buses the campaign warns new yorkers of the dangers of realistic looking toy guns and the dangers of real guns that are painted to look like toys the campaign 8217 s advertisements demonstrate potential confusion about gun coloration and warn people that it is illegal either to make a fake gun look real or make a real gun look like a toy new yorkers are encouraged to call 311 about either problem calls to 311 that concern real guns that look fake will be forwarded to the police department 8217 s gun stop hotline callers can receive a 1 , 000 reward for information that leads to a conviction and can remain anonymous the city has received a grant from the new york state division of criminal justice services to support the ad campaign 8220 gun violence is plaguing the bedford stuyvesant and crown heights neighborhoods that i represent , as well as communities across the city and country , 8221 said council member al vann , prime sponsor of the bill 8220 when i introduced this legislation , my intentions were also to stem the glorification of guns within our communities , and push the businesses that we patronize to be responsible members of our neighborhoods i will continue working to address gun violence and its underlying issues in light of the senseless shooting that occurred in my district sunday night , it is apparent that we must work more diligently to stem the violence that is afflicting our neighborhoods 8221 8220 there is little debate that realistic looking toy guns pose a serious threat to the safety and welfare of police officers and new yorkers as a whole , 8221 stated deputy majority leader leroy comrie 8220 sadly , violence resulting from toy guns has happened too many times in this city this bill is a common sense solution to a very serious threat to our safety 8221 8220 toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys threaten the safety of our dedicated police officers and our children , especially during this holiday season , 8221 said criminal justice coordinator john feinblatt 8220 this public awareness campaign will help to educate the public about the dangers posed by these guns 8221 8220 imitation firearms that look real are not party items to be wrapped up and given as gifts during the holiday season , and they 8217 re certainly not toys , 8221 said consumer affairs commissioner jonathan mintz 8220 dca appreciates the council 8217 s strong and unequivocal message to the city 8217 s retailers who must do right by their customers and their communities by keeping these dangerous items off their shelves forever 8221 8220 with the holiday season in full swing , it is particularly important to bring attention to the fact that toy guns can cause accidents resulting in serious injury or death , 8221 said council member maria del carmen arroyo , co chair of the black , latino and asian caucus 8220 time and time again our communities are at risk and at serious danger when someone carries what is perceived to be a fake gun i want to thank the speaker and the administration for strengthening the penalties in hopes that repeat offenders cease to sell improper toy guns 8221 8220 last month an there was an unfortunate incident in my district where a young teen was shot by police because they mistook his toy gun for a fake one , 8221 said council member larry seabrook 8220 we need to hold these toy gun sellers accountable for selling such a heinous product our children 8217 s lives are at stake it is my hope that these penalties will finally deter stores from selling these toys our communities need to work together i ask when they see someone selling bad toy guns or when they see someone concealing a real gun for a fake one to call 311 8221 8220 this legislation will help prevent further violence by deterring businesses from selling toy guns that look real , 8221 said council member melissa mark viverito 8220 the increased regulations created by this bill will not only prevent toy guns from being used to commit crimes , but also will avert children from being wounded or killed by confused police officers who mistake their toy for a real gun 8221 8220 harlem mothers s a v e fully supports the action to increase penalties for store owners who are repeat offenders of the law and we agree that the city should have the authority to shut down such establishments and prevent their further endangering lives of our children and safety of community , said jackie rowe adams , co founder under new york city 8217 s public safety law , it is against the law to sell or offer to sell any toy or imitation firearm that can reasonably be perceived to be an actual firearm unless the exterior surface of the toy or imitation firearm is predominantly brightly colored the range of acceptable colors includes white , bright red , bright orange , bright yellow , bright green , bright blue , bright pink or bright purple","the desperate flailings of a city with absolutely no common sense they 're so impotent in their abilities to get tough on criminals , they feel it necessary to go after the most unrelated

is dr olsen 's letter in it 's entirety national museum of natural history smithsonian institution washington , d c 20560 1 november 1999 open letter to dr peter raven , secretary praven nas org committee for research and exploration national geographic society washington , dc 20036 dear peter , i thought that i should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the national geographic society with the publication of feathers for t rex \? by christopher p sloan in its november issue , national geographic has reached an all time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism but at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature although it is possible that mr czerkas will later name the specimen identified on page 100 as archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so because this latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full spread photograph of the specimen accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , the name archaeoraptor liaoningensis sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in national geographic \( international code of zoological nomenclature , article 13a , i \) this is the worst nightmare of many zoologists that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist clearly , national geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that the czerkases now plan to return it to china in washington , in june of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th international meeting of the society of avian paleontology and evolution , held at the smithsonian institution , were signatories to a letter to the director of the chinese academy of sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from china and encouraged the chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation there were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message thus , at least since mid 1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from liaoning offered for sale outside of china are contraband most , if not all , major natural history museums in the united states have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin the national geographic society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions prior to the publication of the article dinosaurs take wing in the july 1998 national geographic , lou mazzatenta , the photographer for sloan 's article , invited me to the national geographic society to review his photographs of chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story at that time , i tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what national geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that national geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that makes the news rather than reporting it his bald statement that we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing this melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned more importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact the statement on page 103 that hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical the hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the national geographic society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers a model of the undisputed dinosaur deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction the idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at nature and national geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion if sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken but it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , national geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode sincerely , storrs

1163@6,"vermont legalizes gay marriage chicagotribune com chicagotribune com vermont legalizes gay marriage the associated press 6 57 pm cdt , april 7 , 2009 montpelier , vt the marriage proposal came not over a candlelit dinner or on a scenic mountaintop instead the couple were surrounded by a throng of gay rights supporters outside the vermont house chamber we have n't decided who 's going to propose to who yet , former lawmaker robert dostis said as he stood next to his longtime partner , chuck kletecka but we 've been together 25 years in september , and i think september 14th would be a nice wedding day sounds good to me , kletecka replied i accept the exchange came just after the vermont house narrowly achieved the two thirds majority necessary to overcome republican gov jim douglas' veto of a gay marriage bill vermont was the first state to give gay and lesbian couples legal recognition with its civil unions law in 2000 it jumped to the lead again tuesday after courts in three other states had legalized gay marriage , vermont became the first to have its legislature do so on its own bills to allow same sex marriage are currently before lawmakers in new hampshire , maine , new york and new jersey the three other states that allow same sex marriage connecticut , massachusetts and iowa moved to do so first through the courts , not their legislatures for a popularly elected legislature to make this decision is a much more democratic process because lawmakers have to answer to the voters every other november , said eric davis , a retired middlebury college political science professor courts typically deal with arcane points of constitutional law while legislatures debate some of the same principles , the process may become much more personal in vermont , some of the most gripping debate came when gay lawmakers took to the house floor last thursday and told their own love stories getting gay marriage approved in a political , rather than purely legal , forum is a big step , said boston university law professor linda mclain , an expert on family law and policy what may give courage to other legislatures is that this legislature managed to do it , she said she added that using the civil rights language of equality the measure in vermont was dubbed the marriage equality bill could help make gay marriage more acceptable elsewhere opponents said they , too , believe activists will be emboldened in other states and could attack the 1996 defense of marriage act , which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and provides that states need not recognize the marriage of a same sex couple from another state the vermont action comes just days after the iowa supreme court ruled that not permitting gay marriage there was unconstitutional to the millions of americans who care about marriage , we say , 'get ready president obama and democrats will use vermont as an excuse to overturn the bipartisan federal defense of marriage act , ' said brian brown , executive director of the national organization for marriage , which waged a radio campaign against the measure the next step is to ask the supreme court to impose gay marriage on all 50 states to date , the same sex marriage movement 's main gains have been in new england , which some attribute to yankee liberalism and the gradual acceptance of gay relationships after vermont 's groundbreaking civil unions law took effect in 2000 douglas had announced his intent to veto the gay marriage bill two weeks ago , saying he believed marriage should be limited to a man and a woman and calling the issue a distraction from more important economic and budgetary issues in tuesday 's vote , a yes was needed from two thirds of those present to override the governor 's veto the goal was easily achieved in the senate , which voted 23 5 , but in the house the vote was much closer , 100 49 the speaker 's announcement of the results to a packed statehouse chamber set off whistles and cheers among supporters whose hopes had been temporarily dashed when the governor announced he would veto the measure if it passed the legislature among the celebrants were kletecka and dostis , who recalled efforts to expand gay rights dating to an anti discrimination law passed in 1992 it 's been almost 20 years to get to this point , dostis said i think finally , most people in vermont understand that we 're a couple like any other couple we 're as good and as bad as any other group of people craig bensen , a gay marriage opponent who had lobbied unsuccessfully for a nonbinding referendum on the question , said his side was outspent by supporters by 20 1 the other side had a highly funded , extremely well oiled machine with all the political leadership except the governor pushing to make this happen , he said the fact that it came down to this tight a vote is really astounding the measure had only 95 yes votes when it passed the house on friday but some changed their votes tuesday rep jeff young , d st albans , who voted no twice because he 's philosophically opposed to gay marriage , joined most other democrats in voting to override douglas' veto i think if i wanted to continue my career here and have any chance of being effective , i had to vote with my caucus , he said you have some pet projects , you think you can help your district back home with things that need to happen i want to get a railroading bill through i would n't even have had a chance to testify , let alone get it through now , people will listen

should it be changed too \? there are no easy solutions to the problem we as a society are facing but blaming guns or free speech for our problems is like saying flies cause garbage it is easy to blame guns for our problems but they are merely a tool , like a shovel , that unless put into use by a person or persons it merely just sits there and does nothing our society has pushed the issue of not being responsible or held accoutable for your actions way to far i do have a solution to these problems , but most would find it offensive what the hell , i 've probably offended alot already , so here goes we have a three time loser law , that if you have three felony convictions you are considered a career criminal now alot of those crimes involve firearms so if you are convicted of three felony firearms crimes , you should get the death penalty to be carried out immediately it will take some time to get the message across but ii do believe when the message gets out , firearms crimes will be reduced drastically well , i need to get some things done so i 'll write more later later all","i think you hit it pretty much on the money gun control does not cure anger , hate , and violence talk about responsibility gun grabbers blame you and me and our behavior for the violence in this country they blame everyone except the one who pulls the trigger and takes human life",gun control,1

left leaning religious groups , some corporations who will reap a financial windfall from a switch to alternative fuel sources , and some politicians scientists disagree while each of the above claims

claim s the global warming debate is over not so , wrote singer singer wrote , sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the epa u s environmental protection agency says and temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree f not exactly a catastrophe added singer in a subsequent letter to the canadian media , thousands of scientists from many countries now fully understand that kyoto and other efforts to control human emissions of carbon dioxide \( co2 \) are ineffective and entirely unfounded scientifically even if you ignore the enormous cost of kyoto \( estimated recently by prof george taylor of oregon state university see http www sitewave net news s49p628 htm at one trillion u s dollars a year for full implementation in oecd countries \) , climate science research is rapidly moving away from the hypothesis that the human release of greenhouse gases , specifically co2 , is in any way significantly contributing to global climate change sun called primary cause if we just look at the historical data , there is a scientific consensus that the global mean temperature has risen modestly during the twentieth century , said myron ebell , director of global warming and environmental policy at the competitive enterprise institute the impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate this historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences the controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations , according to dr benny peiser of england 's john moore 's university , is solar ray activity six eminent researchers from the russian academy of science and the israel space agency have just published a startling paper in one of the world 's leading space science journals the team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the earth 's climate , peiser was quoted as saying in the may 17 national post moreover , reports peiser , jan veizer , one of canada 's top earth scientists , published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded , empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate , with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers added peiser , in fact , the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus' is not restricted to individual scientists it also includes distinguished scientific organizations such as the russian academy of science and the u s association of state climatologists , both of which are highly skeptical of the whole idea heartland institute article and here 's more renowned scientist defects from belief in global warming 8211 caps year of vindication for skeptics october 17 , 2006 october 17 , 2006 washington dc one of the most decorated french geophysicists has converted from a believer in manmade catastrophic global warming to a climate skeptic this latest defector from the global warming camp caps a year in which numerous scientific studies have bolstered the claims of climate skeptics scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media promoted scientific 8220 consensus 8221 on climate alarmism claude allegre , a former government official and an active member of france 8217 s socialist party , wrote an editorial on september 21 , 2006 in the french newspaper l'express titled 8220 the snows of kilimanjaro 8221 \( for english translation , click here u s senate committee on environment and public works \) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming see http www lexpress fr idees tribune asp \? ida 451670 allegre wrote that the 8220 cause of climate change remains unknown 8221 and pointed out that kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming , but to local land use and precipitation changes allegre also pointed out that studies show that antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice 8220 following the month of august experienced by the northern half of france , the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes , 8221 allegre wrote he also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money , noting that 8220 the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people ! 8221 allegre , a member of both the french and u s academy of sciences , had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming by burning fossil fuels , man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century , allegre wrote 20 years ago in addition , allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a november 18 , 1992 letter titled 8220 world scientists' warning to humanity 8221 in which the scientists warned that global warming 8217 s 8220 potential risks are very great 8221 see warning to humanity allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles , written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the goldschmidt medal from the geochemical society of the united states allegre 's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a 8220 consensus 8221 about manmade global warming proponents of global warming have ratcheted up the level of rhetoric on climate skeptics recently an environmental magazine in september called for nuremberg style trials for global warming skeptics and cbs news 8220 60 minutes 8221 correspondent scott pelley compared skeptics to 8220 holocaust deniers 8221 see u s senate committee on environment and public works amp scott pelley and catherine herrick on global warming coverage public eye in addition , former vice president al gore has repeatedly referred to skeptics as global warming deniers this increase in rhetorical flourish comes at a time when new climate science research continues to unravel the global warming alarmists 8217 computer model predictions of future climatic doom and vindicate skeptics 60 scientists debunk global warming fears earlier this year , a group of prominent scientists came forward to question the so called 8220 consensus 8221 that the earth faces a 8220 climate emergency 8221 on april 6 , 2006 , 60 scientists wrote a letter to the canadian prime minister asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists 8220 observational evidence does not support today 's computer climate models , so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future 8230 significant scientific advances have been made since the kyoto protocol was created , many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases if , back in the mid 1990s , we knew what we know today about climate , kyoto would almost certainly not exist , because we would have concluded it was not necessary , 8221 the 60 scientists wrote see open kyoto to debate 8220 it was only 30 years ago that many of today 's global warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global cooling catastrophe but the science continued to evolve , and still does , even though so many choose to ignore it when it does not fit with predetermined political agendas , 8221 the 60 scientists concluded u s senate committee on environment and public works

complains an indignant supporter of abortion and how can you call yourself a loving christian if you would force a victim of violent rape to give birth to a rapist 's child \? every pro lifer has heard these same challenges in one form or another they are the emotionally charged questions designed to prove either 1 \) that pro lifers are insensitive fetus lovers , 2 \) or ethically inconsistent , allowing abortion for some circumstances but not others unfortunately , most pro lifers have difficulty answering these challenges because the issue of sexual assault pregnancies is so widely misunderstood typically , both sides of the debate accept the presumption that women with sexual assault pregnancies would want an abortion and that the abortion would in some way help them to recover from the assault thus , the pro lifer is left in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the sanctity of life is more important than the needs of the sexual assault victim with whom everyone should rightly sympathize but in fact , the welfare of the mother and child are never at odds , even in sexual assault cases both the mother and child are helped by preserving life , not by perpetuating violence the reason most people reach the wrong conclusion about abortion in cases of rape and incest is that the actual experiences of sexual assault victims who became pregnant are routinely left out of the debate most people , including sexual assault victims who have never been pregnant , are therefore forming opinions based on prejudices and fears which are disconnected from reality for example , it is commonly assumed that rape victims who become pregnant would naturally want abortions but in the only major study of pregnant rape victims ever done , dr sandra mahkorn found that 75 to 85 percent chose against abortion 1 this evidence alone should cause people to pause and reflect on the presumption that abortion is wanted or even best for sexual assault victims several reasons are given for not aborting first , approximately 70 percent of all women believe abortion is immoral , even though many also feel it should be a legal choice for others approximately the same percentage of pregnant rape victims believe abortion would be just another act of violence perpetrated against their bodies and their children second , some believe that their child 's life may have some intrinsic meaning or purpose which they do not yet understand this child was brought into their lives by a horrible , repulsive act but perhaps god , or fate , will use the child for some greater purpose good can come from evil third , victims of assault often become introspective their sense of the value of life and respect for others is heightened they have been victimized , and the thought that they in turn might victimize their own innocent child through abortion is repulsive fourth , at least at a subconscious level , the victim may sense that if she can get through the pregnancy , she will have conquered the rape by giving birth , she can reclaim some of her lost self esteem giving birth , especially when conception was not desired , is a totally selfless act , a generous act , a display of courage , strength and honor it is proof that she is better than the rapist while he was selfish , she can be generous while he was destroying , she can be nurturing if giving birth builds self respect , what about abortion \? this is a question which most people fail to even consider instead , most people assume that an abortion will at least help a rape victim put the assault behind her and go on with her life but in jumping to this conclusion , the public is adopting an unrealistic view of abortion abortion is not some magical surgery which turns back time to make a woman un pregnant instead , it is a real life event which is always very stressful and often traumatic once we accept that abortion is itself an event with ramifications on a woman 's life , then we must carefully look at the special circumstances of the pregnant rape victim will an abortion truly console her , or will it only cause further injury to her already bruised psyche \? in answering this question , it is helpful to begin by noting that many women report that their abortions felt like a degrading and brutal form of medical rape 2 this association between abortion and rape is not hard to understand abortion involves a painful examination of a woman 's sexual organs by a masked stranger who is invading her body once she is on the operating table , she loses control over her body if she protests and asks for the abortionist to stop , she will likely be ignored or told it 's too late to change your mind this is what you wanted we have to finish now and while she lies there tense and helpless , the life hidden within her is literally sucked out of her womb the difference \? in a sexual rape , a woman is robbed of her purity in this medical rape she is robbed of her maternity this experiential association between abortion and sexual assault is very strong for many women it is especially strong for women who have a prior history of sexual assault , whether or not she is presently pregnant as the result of an assault 3 this is just one reason why women with a history of sexual assault are likely to experience greater distress during and after an abortion than other women second , research shows that after any abortion , it is common for women to experience guilt , depression , feelings of being dirty , resentment of men , and lowered self esteem what is most significant is that these feelings are identical to what women typically feel after rape abortion , then , only adds to and accentuates the traumatic feelings associated with sexual assault rather than easing the psychological burdens of the sexual assault victim , abortion adds to them this was the experience of jackie bakker , who reports i soon discovered that the aftermath of my abortion continued a long time after the memory of my rape had faded i felt empty and horrible nobody told me about the pain i would feel deep within causing nightmares and deep depressions they had all told me that after the abortion i could continue my life as if nothing had happened those encouraging abortion often do so because they are uncomfortable dealing with rape victims , or perhaps out of prejudice against victims whom they see as being guilty for letting it happen wiping out the pregnancy is a way of hiding the problem it is a quick and easy way to avoid dealing with the woman 's true emotional , social and financial needs according to kathleen dezeeuw , i , having lived through rape , and also having raised a child 'conceived in rape , ' feel personally assaulted and insulted every time i hear that abortion should be legal because of rape and incest i feel that we 're being used by pro abortionists to further the abortion issue , even though we 've not been asked to tell our side the case against abortion of incest pregnancies is even stronger studies show that incest victims rarely ever voluntarily agree to an abortion 4 instead of viewing the pregnancy as unwanted , the incest victim is more likely to see the pregnancy as a way out of the incestuous relationship because the birth of her child will expose the sexual activity she is also likely to see in her pregnancy the hope of bearing a child with whom she can establish a true loving relationship , one far different than the exploitive relationship in which she has been trapped but while the incest victim may treasure her pregnancy because it offers her hope of release , and the hope of finding a nurturing love , her pregnancy is a threat to the exploiter it is also a threat to the pathological secrecy which may envelop other members of the family who are afraid to acknowledge that the abuse is occurring because of this dual threat , the victim may be coerced into an unwanted abortion by both the abuser and other family members for example , edith young , a 12 year old victim of incest impregnated by her stepfather , writes twenty five years after the abortion of her child throughout the years i have been depressed , suicidal , furious , outraged , lonely , and have felt a sense of loss the abortion which was to 'be in my best interest' just has not been as far as i can tell , it only 'saved their reputations , ' 'solved their problems , ' and 'allowed their lives to go merrily on ' my daughter , how i miss her so i miss her regardless of the reason for her conception abortion providers who ignore this evidence , and neglect to interview minors presented for abortion for signs of coercion or incest , are actually contributing to the young girl 's victimization they are not only robbing the victim of her child , they are concealing a crime , abetting a perpetrator , and handing the victim back to her abuser so that the exploitation can continue finally , we must recognize that the children conceived through sexual assault also have a voice which deserves to be heard julie makimaa , conceived by an act of rape , works diligently against the perception that abortion is acceptable or even necessary in cases of sexual assault while sympathetic to the suffering her mother endured at the hands of her attacker , julie is also rightfully proud of her mother 's courage and generosity regarding her own view of her origin , julie proclaims it does n't matter how i began what matters is who i will become that 's a slogan we can all live with",abortion,0

1352@5,"court seattle police ok to stun pregnant woman by gene johnson 8232 associated press writer seattle three seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent malaika brooks was driving her son to seattle 's african american academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone she insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she 'd be admitting guilt rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her one reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her the officers sgt steven daman , officer juan ornelas and officer donald jones then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face down in the street brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later , but has permanent scars from the taser she sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights , and u s district judge richard jones allowed the case to continue he declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said brooks' rights were clearly violated but in a 2 1 ruling friday , a panel of the 9th u s circuit court of appeals disagreed judges cynthia holcomb hall and diarmuid f o'scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest the use of force was also justified because of the threat brooks posed , hall wrote it seems clear that brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment 's notice nonetheless , some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained , particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation they also noted that the force used was n't that serious because the taser was in touch mode rather than dart mode , which hurts more they reversed the lower court 's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit the officers' lawyers , ted buck and karen cobb , said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders , buck said that 's all the court recognized today the 9th circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances the majority 's opinion outraged judge marsha berzon , who called it off the wall i fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against brooks , let alone three activations of a taser , in response to such a trivial offense , she wrote she argued that under washington law , the officers had no authority to take brooks into custody failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense , and it 's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest berzon said the majority 's notion that brooks obstructed officers was so far fetched that even the officers themselves did n't make that legal argument to obstruct an officer , one must obstruct the officer 's official duties , and the officers' only duties in this case were to detain brooks long enough to identify her , check for warrants , write up the citation and give it to her brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties , she said furthermore , brooks posed no apparent threat , and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus , or whether it might prompt premature labor another reason their actions were inexcusable , berzon said brooks' lawyer , eric zubel , said he would ask the 9th circuit to rehear the case this is outrageous that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman , in front of an elementary school , at 8 30 in the morning , to someone who posed no threat whatsoever , he said",one wonders if there was n't an element of racism involved,abortion,0
1352@6,"if one agrees to a discussion without using the bible as some people insist , then they have set the terms of the debate in essence these terms are 1 facts are neutral however , there are no such things as brute facts all facts are interpreted once the bible is eliminated in the argument , then the christians presuppositions are gone , leaving them unable to effectively give an alternate interpretation of the facts their opponents then have the upper hand as they still have their presuppositions see naturalism , logic and reality","this is where intuitive , ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble all facts are interpreted according to presuppositions , so it 's only fair that creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else , right \? well , let 's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour , and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly should he be allowed to sit in judgement \? of course not but according to the reasoning presented by aig that leaves us in an impossible position by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race , we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy we readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence ah , but ! is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition , another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted \? one might protest that it is not , that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically but it would be in vain , because there are , after all , no such thing as 'brute facts' the data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race agnostic to someone whose presupposition is otherwise , your 'facts' mean something quite different they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased , or at least faulty in some unknown way in short , following ken ham 's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight we can venture to justify no opinion or belief , because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another i may if i so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself , and i am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument , for the axioms by which i choose to interpret the world are , in ken 's eyes , inviolate this is hardly the result ken could have intended what 's gone wrong \? why has his fair minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly \? the answer , of course , is that the playing field is n't really level every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly , and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place the world thus far has remained largely unimpressed this is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates , and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma good axioms yield accurate predictions as ken rightly observed , known facts are always subject to interpretation but the reverse process , the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory , is not in making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find this yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality this understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal the racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant , but his low 'hit rate' would invalidate his axiom so , part of what distinguishes creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that , in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark the discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible , as should identically located retroviral insertions we should not have found fossils at all , let alone a nested hierarchy of forms we should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation we should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies all of these unexpected face plants for creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact shared pseudogenes must all have some function we do n't know about there must be some determinism in the location of ervs fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the great flood the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past but these rationalisations entail further predictions we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional but we can if erv insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab but we do n't if fossils were laid down by the flood we would n't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth , or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains , and we would n't expect there to be anything like as much limestone if decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10 , 000 years , we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air and so on science also changes to accommodate the unexpected but as often as not the 'unexpected' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions , predicting something we did n't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed and that 's the bottom line creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge , but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions , indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality , creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that it would certainly appear thus far make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur",evolution,1

leading climatologists spent the month of june rebutting such proclamations atmospheric physicist s fred singer , professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the university of virginia and former director of the u s weather satellite service , sent a letter to the editor of usa today directly refuting its claim your editorial claim s the global warming debate is over not so , wrote singer singer wrote , sea level will continue to rise by only seven inches per century as it has for thousands of years no matter what we do or what the epa u s environmental protection agency says and temperatures in the next 100 years will likely rise by less than one degree f not exactly a catastrophe added singer in a subsequent letter to the canadian media , thousands of scientists from many

cost of kyoto \( estimated recently by prof george taylor of oregon state university see http www sitewave net news s49p628 htm at one trillion u s dollars a year for full implementation in oecd

myron ebell , director of global warming and environmental policy at the competitive enterprise institute the impacts have been small and probably beneficial in aggregate this historical data puts the onus of demonstration on those who think this gradual warming trend will accelerate and lead to dire consequences the controlling driver of global temperature fluctuations , according to dr benny

one of the world 's leading space science journals the team of solar physicists claims to have come up with compelling evidence that changes in cosmic ray intensity and variations in solar activity have been driving much of the earth 's climate , peiser was quoted as saying in the may 17 national post moreover , reports peiser , jan veizer , one of canada 's top earth scientists , published a comprehensive review of recent findings and concluded , empirical observations on all time scales point to celestial phenomena as the principal driver of climate , with greenhouse gases acting only as potential amplifiers added peiser , in fact , the explicit and implicit rejection of the 'consensus' is not restricted to individual scientists it also includes distinguished scientific organizations

of climate skeptics scientific studies that debunk the dire predictions of human caused global warming have continued to accumulate and many believe the new science is shattering the media promoted scientific consensus on climate alarmism claude allegre , a former government official and an active member of frances socialist party , wrote an editorial on september 21 , 2006 in the french newspaper l'express titled the snows of kilimanjaro \( for english translation , click here u s senate committee on environment and public works \) detailing his newfound skepticism about manmade global warming see http www lexpress fr idees tribune asp \? ida 451670 allegre wrote that the cause of climate change remains unknown and pointed out that kilimanjaro is not losing snow due to global warming , but to local land use and precipitation changes allegre also pointed out that studies show that antarctic snowfall rate has been stable over the past 30 years and the continent is actually gaining ice following the month of august experienced by the northern half of france , the prophets of doom of global warming will have a lot on their plate in order to make our fellow countrymen swallow their certitudes , allegre wrote he also accused proponents of manmade catastrophic global warming of being motivated by money , noting that the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people ! allegre , a member of both the french and u s academy of sciences , had previously expressed concern about manmade global warming by burning fossil fuels , man enhanced the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century , allegre wrote 20 years ago in addition , allegre was one of 1500 scientists who signed a november 18 , 1992 letter titled world scientists' warning to humanity in which the scientists warned that global warmings potential risks are very great see warning to humanity allegre has authored more than 100 scientific articles , written 11 books and received numerous scientific awards including the goldschmidt medal from the geochemical society of the united states allegre 's conversion to a climate skeptic comes at a time when global warming alarmists have insisted that there is a consensus about manmade global warming proponents of global

asserting that the science is deteriorating from underneath global warming alarmists observational evidence does not support today 's computer climate models , so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the futuresignificant scientific advances have been made since the kyoto protocol was created , many of which are taking us away from a concern about increasing greenhouse gases if , back in the mid 1990s , we knew what we know today about climate , kyoto would almost certainly not exist , because we would have concluded it was not necessary , the 60 scientists wrote see open kyoto to debate it was only 30 years ago that many of today 's global warming alarmists were telling us that the world was in the midst of a global cooling catastrophe but the science continued to

1428@1,"typical little child , all he can offer is condescending insults while never daring to refute the arguments made but you 're in good company as that is all your cohorts can do also you must reject and denigrate that which is just as reasonable an explanation of the available evidence as your side offers that 's why it 's a waste of time going around in circles with you guys but i 've made my point again , what is shown very clearly from all of these scientific interpretation of the same evidence is that there are two ways to interpret it but for you evos to claim victory based on your interpretation which is as biased as ours is , is the epitome of arrogance we may have to agree to disagree peeling , but do n't you dare just assume you 're right and the debate is over because you have proven nothing absolutely","how do you interpret all those extant historical records bracketing the flood date by several hundred years , as shown by sinjin , which record no such event \?",evolution,0
1428@5,"that 's not what i was talking to the logic is whatever god does is morally just and even if the act independent of god is evil , the fact that god did it makes it morally just because god did it people like arch would call pol pot 's extermination evil , but when god does the same to millions in the flood , it 's morally just despite being extermination both ways thus , because god is the one killing people , the act of killing that would normally be immoral becomes moral thus , whatever god does in the eyes of people like arch is morally just independent of what the act actually is","exactamundo , finally the ignoramus gets something right",abortion,1
1429@1,equality is not defined by you or me it is defined by the creator who created men,"actually i think it is defined by the creator who created all women but in reality your opinion is gibberish equality is , like every other word , defined by the people who use the language currently it means the same people are n't equal because they are not all the same any attempt to argue otherwise is a display of gross stupidity",abortion,0
1429@3,"for me , it would therefore have made no difference if i had been aborted in the first or second trimester or if i had never been conceived either way , i never would have existed so , i have no problem in general with abortions in the first and second trimester however , i would strictly limit third trimester abortions since i can empathize with mentally existing beings and would not want them to be killed without very good reason , as i would not want to be killed without good reason so , what are your views on this issue or your own moral approaches \?",it logically follows from the moral foundation set up but you made to important claims or proclamations as you called it 1 \) treat others as you wish to be treated \( golden rule \) and 2 \) mental existence is required to have value my morality was already nicely summed up by you \( atleast part of it \),abortion,1
