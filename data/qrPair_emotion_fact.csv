if ken ham said that it would not mean much what they are both saying is that the people who promote the dinosaurs to birds scenario are lying propagandist , not scientist just so you ca n't say i took it out of context here is dr olsen 's letter in it 's entirety national museum of natural history smithsonian institution washington , d c 20560 1 november 1999 open letter to dr peter raven , secretary praven nas org committee for research and exploration national geographic society washington , dc 20036 dear peter , i thought that i should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the national geographic society with the publication of feathers for t rex \? by christopher p sloan in its november issue , national geographic has reached an all time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism but at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature although it is possible that mr czerkas will later name the specimen identified on page 100 as archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so because this latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full spread photograph of the specimen accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , the name archaeoraptor liaoningensis sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in national geographic \( international code of zoological nomenclature , article 13a , i \) this is the worst nightmare of many zoologists that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist clearly , national geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that the czerkases now plan to return it to china in washington , in june of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th international meeting of the society of avian paleontology and evolution , held at the smithsonian institution , were signatories to a letter to the director of the chinese academy of sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from china and encouraged the chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation there were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message thus , at least since mid 1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from liaoning offered for sale outside of china are contraband most , if not all , major natural history museums in the united states have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin the national geographic society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions prior to the publication of the article dinosaurs take wing in the july 1998 national geographic , lou mazzatenta , the photographer for sloan 's article , invited me to the national geographic society to review his photographs of chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story at that time , i tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what national geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that national geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that makes the news rather than reporting it his bald statement that we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing this melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned more importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact the statement on page 103 that hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical the hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the national geographic society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers a model of the undisputed dinosaur deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction the idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at nature and national geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion if sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken but it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , national geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode sincerely , storrs

harada held the rifle and commented , it 's heavy , is n't it \? adding , not everybody has a chance to hold it , right \? he held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back biwako broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised the tv crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting the prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer the intervention by the police flabbergasted harada and employees of other tv stations i never could have imagined anything like this , harada , a former member of the male comedy duo anonenone , told reporters after he was questioned by police on june 2 i was stunned akihiko ito , head of the tv station 's programming department , said the station would cooperate with police , but defended harada 's actions we consulted our lawyers , and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it , he said a spokesperson with a tv station based in osaka sharply criticized police they should have at least asked \( biwako broadcasting \) to cooperate voluntarily , a spokesperson said from a common sense standpoint , we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking an employee at another tv station was also critical if we , for example , were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife , would the police investigate us , too \? the employee asked such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs this would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming but police say they do n't understand what all the fuss is about they say the media has , by focusing on the celebrity angle , blurred the facts in the case a senior official with the shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that harada briefly held the rifle , but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of storage and management an explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law , which took effect in january the law was tightened after a 37 year old man in sasebo , nagasaki prefecture , shot and killed two people and wounded six in december 2007 the man , known for erratic behavior , committed suicide after the shooting the incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate i believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the tv crew lacked an awareness of the firearm 's potential danger , another police official said according to the national police agency , police can file a case against anybody if he or she , with criminal intent to kill or injure people , possesses a weapon for even a second a case can be built based not on the length of time of possession , but on the purpose of possession , the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner the shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show by transporting the gun to the show , the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit , police asserted they defended questioning harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon \? takaaki hattori , professor of media law at rikkyo university in tokyo , says that police went too far the way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing i sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law , he said they should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities but he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent the tv station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show the gun owner may have been primarily responsible , but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law takaaki matsumiya , professor of criminal law at ritsumeikan university school of law in kyoto , disagrees that the tv station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities citing a precedent set by the tokyo high court in june 1967 , he said the high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession , ' he said there have been no precedents to alter that interpretation harada did not 'possess' it \( during the show \) matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set when the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason' for bearing and carrying a firearm , it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm , he said it is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances \( iht asahi july 2 , 2009 \) now then , what 's all this bull about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to america \? i do n't see such being the case , do you \? if you ca n't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law , that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else how can japan be so much better off than we are , if it 's a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep especially when it 's unloaded ! \?",a taste of what could be our future if the left has its way,gun control,0

weeping , rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted , because her children are no more \( niv \) jer 31 15 when herod realized that he had been outwitted by the magi , he was furious , and he gave orders to kill all the boys in bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under then the prophecy was fulfilled \( niv \) matt 2 16 4 1 through the prophet jeremiah ,

they had departed , behold , an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream , saying , arise , take the young child and his mother , flee to egypt , and stay there until i bring you word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him when he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night and departed for egypt , and was there until the death of herod , that it might be fulfilled

says that messiah would come from egypt jesus had to be born into the family of david , born of a virgin , born in bethlehem , children would die and jesus come out of egypt the prophet must have wondered why messiah would come out of egypt this did not fit the concept the jews had about messiah this is god 's plan and these are god 's prophecies they divide my garments among them , and for my clothing they cast lots \( nkjv \) ps 22 18 then they crucified him , and divided his garments , casting lots , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they divided my garments

then they will look on me whom they pierced \( nkjv \) zech 12 10 but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came out for these things occurred that the

398@4,"thanks patriot for the well researched response although i am not a gun rights advocate , i am also not anti gun and in the spirit of trying to get the two sides of this issue to reach some sort of understanding , here is what i believe to be the major points of those who support a ban on assult weapons first of all , i do agree that the definition of assult weapons is a little strange , and it essentially boils down to the guns that look scary however , the spirit of the law was to try to ban weapons whose main purpose was militaristic in nature that is , guns that are able to be fired rapidly , have a large magazine , and reasonable stopping power thus , although the ban would not eliminate all of the dangerous weapons \( i assume that an m1 , the rifle that beat the nazis , would be legal \) it does cover a lot of them of course , most 2nd amendment rights supporters would say that all this does n't matter , it does n't matter what purpose the gun serves , it is unconstitutional to infringe upon the rights of americans to own any gun they want , no matter the purpose what gun control advocates would say , however , is that the constitution says 'arms' not guns , and it becomes the job of the goverment to determine what was meant my this i think that most gun control advocates would agree that the second amendment probably did not intend for people to be able to buy chemical or biological weapons , for example and , i for one , hope that is not what they meant , particularly in light of the recent war on terrorism a common remark is why would it matter if i had a nuclear weapon if i am a law abiding citizen and would never use it against my neighbor \? the problem is that we do n't know what the intention of everyone is , and there are certainly terrorists in this country now who are american citizens and would use such powerful weapons against usif they were able to acquire them of course a semi automatic 223 caliber rifle is not the same as a chemical weapon , but the point is that \( i think \) most people do n't think that you should be able to own absolutely any weapon that you want , so one must attempt to define what is too dangerous for ordinary citizens to own i do n't think that i covered all of your points , patriot , but this is getting long , so i will cut this off here , and i hope to get a response from you i will be interested in your thoughts dan","the ban on assault weapons stands on such poltically weak and constitutionally weak ground that congress only had the guts and the will to try it for 10 years it expires this year the right to own arms is expressly clear it shall not be infringed by congress the federal government is fully empowed to keep arms away from convicted fellons , it does not have the power to limit them from citizens those people who you do n't know \( what they may do \) \? when the government is effective enough to prevent crime or has the power to do so , then we no longer live in a free society keep in mind that free choice also allows a person to decide to break the law it cuts both ways , you can not take away the choice to break laws and allow good citizens truely be free the only governments through history that have been effective in crime prevention has been tyranically communist countries with extensive secret police the present people in former communist block countries today are sad to see thier streets full of crime , they recall back in the day how safe it way to walk down dark streets in saftey yes they were safe from criminals , they were not safe from the secret police the moment the secret police eyed you for real or imagined statistical probability of breaking a crime or become a political enemy , you dissapeared and no one ever saw you alive again the wmd analogy is poor you will not find any vendors please find another one there may be constitutionally poor arguments in favor of banning wmds for civilians , that argument is moot you will not find any vendor the constitution protects my right to own arms that does not mean arms vendors must be forced to sell thier product to me if i want one that argument is moot the firearms act decided that sawed off shot guns and the thompson machine gun is to be banned from civilian ownership early supreme court decisions support this early judicial opinion of the the firearms act was based on the fact that the thompson and sawed off shot gun was not a military serviceable weapon and does not apply to the 2nd amendment the thompson and sawed off shotgun were not used by the us army guess what \? the thompson was adpoted by the army a few years later so then , what does that mean \? judicial opinion is of the direction that military serviceable weapons are protected by the 2nd amendment what does that mean for the assault rifle ban \? it means it is on shakey constitutional ground some points i have for you 1 \) flash supressor \? argued by anti gunners prevent shooters from hiding thier position completely false flash hiders can hide flash from the target it 's main purpose is to hide flash from the shooter ! the flash startles the shooter and makes bullets ballistically unstable excessive muzzle flash happens when unburned powder ignites at the muzzle , causing turbulence behind the bullet with a detrimental effect on accuracy http www shootingsoftware com loadens htm flash has more to do with the ammo than the attachment on the end the flash hidder ban has lowered target shooting scores more than protecting lives 2 \) magazine limit \? argued by anti gunners to save lives argued to prevent rapid and large expendature of rounds down range upon victims true , but how often do you hear that \? when it does happen it is national news the real threat is from guns that contain more 2 less than 4 bullets http ip bmjjournals com cgi content abstract 9 2 151 the anti gunners know this and are comming after your 6 shot revolvers next they just wanted people to started getting used it to idea of banning bullet capacity so then the ban on more than 10 bullets \? it really does not do anything than give a false sense of security if public policy productive and actally do something , then the ban on 10 bullets is a farce 3 \) bayonet \? i can not even fathom a reason to ban them other than emotional reasons simly because they look dangerous i suppose is why they are banned will someone please let me know \?

both conservative and liberal http www grisda org origins 22058 htm biblical evidence for the universality of the genesis flood richard m davidson john nevin andrews professor of old testament interpretation old testament department andrews university , berrien springs , michigan origins 22 \( 2 \) 58 73 \( 1995 \) what this article is about the extent of the genesis flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars for those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive , twenty four days , a universal flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column the thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal , universal , world wide genesis flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data the author summarizes twenty two lines of biblical evidence including terminological , thematic , contextual , grammatical syntactical , literary structural , logical conceptual , theological , canonical , and typological which support the universality of the genesis flood please note unfortunately , we are unable to reproduce all of the special accent marks that were present in our printed version of the hebrew transliteration our apologies for any inconvenience this might cause i conflicting schools of interpretation one of the most controversial aspects of the flood narrative concerns the extent of the genesis flood three major positions are taken \( 1 \) the traditional , which asserts the universal , world wide , nature of the deluge \( 2 \) limited or local flood theories , which narrow the scope of the flood story to a particular geographical location in mesopotamia and \( 3 \) non literal \( symbolic \) interpretation , which suggests that the flood story is a non historical account written to teach theological truth against this third position , the non historical , we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the flood in the literary structure of the flood story \( see shea 1979 \) , the genealogical frame or envelope construction \( genesis 5 32 and 9 28 29 \) plus the secondary genealogies \( genesis 6 9 10 and 9 18 19 \) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history the use of the genealogical term tledt \( generations , account \) in the flood story \( 6 9 \) as throughout genesis \( 13 times , structuring the whole book \) , indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of genesis \( doukhan 1978 , p 167 220 \) walter kaiser analyzes the literary form of genesis 1 11 and concludes that this whole section of genesis must be taken as historical narrative prose \( kaiser 1970 \) a number of references in the book of job may allude to the then relatively recent flood \( job 9 5 8 12 14 15 14 11 12 22 15 17 26 10 14 28 9 38 8 11 see morris 1988 , p 26 30 \) the historical occurrence of the flood is part of the saving judging acts of god , and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing flood typology \( see davidson 1981 , p 326 327 \) more on this point later thus according to the biblical writers , far from being a non historical , symbolical , or mythical account written only to teach theological truths , the flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real , literal , historical event for evangelical christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the flood account , the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local , limited flood or a universal , world wide cataclysm the limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological , biological , and anthropological problems for a universal flood \( see boardman 1990 , p 212 223 custance 1979 , p 28 58 kidner 1967 , p 93 95 mitchell 1982 1993 ramm 1954 , p 232 249 young 1977 , p 171 210 \) since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article , i can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable , although much more study is needed a number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long age geology \( see coffin and brown 1983 roth 1985 , 1986a , 1988 whitcomb 1988 baumgardner 1994a , b \) the local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense the various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality they are seen to indicate universality within the writer 's world view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view \( see boardman 1990 , p 223 226 custance 1979 , p 15 27 kidner 1967 , p 93 95 ramm 1954 , p 241 242 \) we will take up this issue in the next section of this article the traditional conservative understanding of the flood narrative is that genesis 6 9 describes a universal , world wide deluge it should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal critical commentators on genesis 6 9 , although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ane accounts and not historical \( see hasel 1975 , p 78 and note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position fohrer , koehler , noth , procksch , skinner , sarna , speiser , von rad , vriezen , zimmerli , etc some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article \) the thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal , universal world wide flood does full justice to the biblical data , and this universal interpretation is crucial for flood theology in genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers ii biblical terminology in genesis 6 9 indicating universality perhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal flood is the specific all inclusive terminology found within the genesis account itself the late gerhard hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of origins \( hasel 1974 , 1975 , 1978 \) , and therefore i need not go into detail in this article eight different terms or phrases in genesis 6 9 , most echoing their counterparts in the world wide creation account of genesis 1 2 , indicate universality first , the term haares the earth , occurring 46 times in the flood narrative \( genesis 6 12 , 13 , 17 , etc \) , always without any accompanying genitive of limitation , clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world wide , universal creation in genesis 1 1 , 2 , 10 \( while the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain land , the explicit link to creation in the flood account \( see especially genesis 6 6 , 7 \) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in genesis 6 9 \) some have argued that if moses had wished to indicate the entire world , he would have used the hebrew term tebel , which means the world as a whole , or dry land in the sense of continents this word is never used in the flood narrative but it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire pentateuch , including the creation account in fact , the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the hebrew bible , but only in poetic texts \( 39 times \) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with haares the earth thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology , and carries little weight a second expression , upon the face of all the earth al pen kol haares \( genesis 7 3 8 9 \) , clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation \( genesis 1 29 cf genesis 1 2 for a related universal expression \) , and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension , i e , the entire surface of the global mass while the shortened term all the earth \( kol haares \) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context \( see exodus 10 5 , 15 numbers 22 5 , 11 1 kings 4 34 10 24 2 chronicles 36 23 genesis 41 57 \) , the immediate context of the flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom god had made and created \( genesis 6 6 , 7 \) to have dominion over all the earth \( genesis 1 26 \) , and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the tower of babel upon the face of all the earth \( genesis 11 4 , 8 , 9 \) in each of the four occurrences of the phrase upon the face of all the earth in genesis outside the flood story \( genesis 1 29 11 4 , 8 , 9 \) , it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe , and there is nothing in the flood narrative to indicate any less universality \( it should be also noted that the one place in genesis where in context a similar phrase upon all the face of the earth is not universal the famine mentioned in genesis 41 56 , the hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in genesis al kol pen haares \) third , the phrase face of the ground pen haadamah \( five times in the flood narrative , 7 4 , 22 , 23 8 8 , 13 \) , occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted , the earth \( 7 23 \) and face of all the earth \( 8 9 \) and this phrase face of the ground likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation \( genesis 2 6 \) fourth , the term kol basar all flesh occurs 12 times in genesis 6 9 \( genesis 6 12 , 13 , 17 , 19 7 16 , 21 8 17 9 11 , 15 , 16 , 17 \) the word kol all \( which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands \) , before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix , as here in genesis 6 9 , indicates totality god 's announcement to destroy all flesh \( genesis 6 13 , 17 \) and the narrator 's comment that all flesh died \( genesis 7 21 22 \) , except the inhabitants of the ark , indicates universal destruction the one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar all the flesh \( in genesis 7 15 \) likewise indicates totality as well as unity fifth , the expression every living thing \( kol hahay \) of all flesh \( genesis 6 19 \) , is another expression of totality in 7 4 , 23 , the similar term kol hayeqm means literally , all existence this term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation all existence that i have made \( 7 4 \) and by the exclusive statement only noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive \( 7 23 \) as hasel puts it there is hardly any stronger way in hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed the writer of the genesis flood story employed terminology , formulae , and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal , world wide flood \( hasel 1975 , p 86 \) sixth , the phrase under the whole heaven \( tahat kol haamayim , genesis 7 19 \) , is used six times in the ot outside of the flood narrative , and always with a universal meaning \( see deuteronomy 2 25 4 19 job 28 24 37 3 41 11 daniel 9 12 \) for example , the phrase is used to describe god 's omniscience for he looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens \( job 28 24 \) again , it depicts god 's sovereignty whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine \( job 41 11 kjv \) \( note that the usage in deuteronomy 2 25 , describing the nations under the whole heaven , is further qualified and limited by the phrase who shall hear the report of you , and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense \) the universal phrase under the whole heaven or under all the heavens also universalizes the phrase under heaven \( genesis 6 17 \) in this same flood context the word heaven alone can have a local meaning e g , 1 kings 18 45 , but here the context is clearly universal ecclesiastes , which contains numerous allusions to creation , likewise utilizes the term under heaven with a universal intention \( ecclesiastes 1 13 2 3 3 1 cf the parallel universal expression under the sun in ecclesiastes 1 3 , 9 2 11 , 17 etc \) in the flood account this phrase under the whole heaven is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the flood and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered the waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward , and the mountains were covered \( 7 19 , 20 \) critical scholar john skinner notes that 7 19 , 20 not only asserts its the flood 's universality , but so to speak proves it , by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains \( skinner 1930 1956 , p 165 \) the biblical language here simply cannot be explained in terms of a local sky , and certainly cannot refer to the local mountains being covered by snow , as some proponents of a local flood suggest h c leupold points out that the writer of vs 19 is not content with a single use of kol \( all \) in all the high mountains , but since 'all' is known to be used in a relative sense , the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens ' a double 'all' \( kol \) cannot allow for so relative a sense it almost constitutes a hebrew superlative so we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the flood \( leupold 1942 , p 301 302 \) seventh , hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase all the fountains mayenoth of the great deep tehm rabbah \( genesis 7 11 8 2 \) , and showed how it is linked with the universal deep \( tehm \) or world ocean in genesis 1 2 \( cf psalm 104 6 thou didst cover it the earth with deep tehm as with a garment the waters were standing above the mountains \) the breaking up and bursting forth \( i e , geological faulting \) of not just one subterranean water spring in mesopotamia , but of all the fountains of the great deep , coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens , far transcends a local scene hasel perceptively concludes that the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about \( hasel 1974 , p 71 \) eighth , in another article , hasel \( 1978 \) shows how the hebrew bible reserved a special term mabbl which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal genesis flood \( 12 occurrences in genesis , once in psalm 29 10 \) this word may be derived from the hebrew root ybl to flow , to stream the term mabbl , which in the flood narrative is usually associated with mayim waters , seems to have become a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood \( deluge \) being caused by waters mabbl is in the old testament a term consistently employed for the flood \( deluge \) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters \( hasel 1978 , p 92 93 \) this technical term clearly sets the genesis deluge apart from all local floods , and is utilized in the psalm 29 10 to illustrate yahweh 's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the noahic flood the lord sat enthroned at the flood , and the lord sits as king forever summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the flood in genesis 6 9 , hasel writes the genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style it expects to be taken literally there is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe to read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects \( hasel 1975 , p 87 \) iii other biblical evidence for a universal flood many additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion we will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text first , the trajectory of major themes in genesis 1 11 creation , fall , plan of redemption , spread of sin is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment we have already noted in reference to specific flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation the creation of the heavens and the earth certainly is not local in scope according to genesis 1 2 likewise , the fall of humanity in adam and eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race \( hadam \) , not just the inhabitants of mesopotamia \( see genesis 6 5 , 11 romans 3 19 5 12 \) again , the protoevangelium \( first gospel promise \) outlined in genesis 3 15 , involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants \( or seed \) of the serpent and the spiritual descendants \( seed \) of the woman , culminating in the victory of the representative messianic seed over the serpent \( see robertson 1980 \) this plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope in a similar way , the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the flood includes more than those living in the fertile crescent from god 's perspective , not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator , we have the results of the divine investigative judgment and god saw that the wickedness of man \( hadam , humankind \) was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually \( genesis 6 5 \) such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment second , the divine purpose given for the bringing of the flood makes explicit its universal scope and the lord said , 'i will destroy man \( hadam \) , humanity whom i have created from the face of the earth both man , and beast , creeping things and birds of the air , for i am sorry that i have made them \( genesis 6 7 \) nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race \( except for noah , 6 8 \) seems envisaged given the length of time from creation \( over 1650 years minimum \) , the longevity of the antediluvians \( nearly a thousand years \) , and god 's command at creation to fill the earth \( genesis 1 28 \) , it is highly unlikely that the pre flood population would have stayed only in mesopotamia thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local flood third , the genealogical lines from both adam \( genesis 4 17 26 5 1 31 \) and noah \( genesis 10 1 32 11 1 9 \) are exclusive in nature , indicating that as adam was father of all pre flood humanity , so noah was father of all post flood humanity from the descendants of noah the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood \( genesis 10 32 \) , and the tower of babel experience spreads humanity across the globe \( genesis 11 1 19 \) striking extra biblical evidence that all human races , and not just the nations of the fertile crescent , are included in the descendants of noah , and retain memory of the universal flood , is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth \( see frazer 1918 , 1 105 361 nelson 1931 \) a world wide flood is by far the most frequently given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity \( thompson 1955 , 1 182 194 \) a remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin , and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea faring vessel the stories nearest to the area of the dispersion at babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account \( see heidel 1946 , jacobsen 1981 , and lambert and millard 1969 \) this vast body of ancient witnesses to a world wide deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical flood fourth , the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both adam and noah \( genesis 1 28 9 1 \) this is another linkage between universal creation and the flood , between the original beginning and the new beginning as the human race at creation flows from adam and eve , so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through noah fifth , the covenant \( genesis 9 9 10 \) with its rainbow sign \( genesis 9 12 17 \) is clearly linked to the extent of the flood , and includes the whole earth \( genesis 9 13 17 \) if there was only a local flood , then the covenant would be only a limited covenant , and the rainbow sign of the all embracing universality of the divine mercy \( delitzsch 1888 1976 , 1 289 290 \) would be stripped of its meaning sixth , the viability of god 's promise \( genesis 9 15 cf isaiah 54 9 \) and the integrity of god in keeping his promise is wrapped up in the world wide extent of the flood this point cannot be underscored too heavily if genesis 6 9 describes only a local flood , then god has broken his promise every time another local flood has happened ! the only way god 's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing \( genesis 8 21 \) can be seen to have been kept is if the flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed seventh , the universality of the flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in genesis 6 14 15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark \( genesis 6 16 21 7 2 3 \) a massive ark filled with representatives of all non aquatic animal plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood , for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds \( genesis 6 19 20 \) as a matter of fact , if only a local flood were in view , the building of any ark at all , even for noah and his family , would have been superfluous god could simply have warned noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment , just as he did with lot in sodom but the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape in the midst of the flood only noah and those who were with him in the ark remained \( genesis 7 23 \) eighth , the covering of all the high mountains by at least 15 cubits \( genesis 7 19 20 \) could not involve simply a local flood , since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe even one high mountain covered in a local mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet 's surface in this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as mt everest at the time of the flood , and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles , as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary \( see ramm 1954 , p 242 \) the antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present passages in the book of job and psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift \( see job 9 5 28 9 and psalm 104 7 8 \) also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise , namely , that a world wide flood would imply that the earth 's surface was completely renovated during the flood year and thus prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography this implication , they claim , is in conflict with biblical evidence which strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography \( young 1977 , p 210 \) reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the garden of eden the lands of havilah and cush , and the four rivers , two of which \( the tigris and the euphrates \) were familiar to the readers of genesis in moses' time what is not recognized in these arguments , however , is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography , there are more differences than similarities two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in moses' time the pishon and gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow , in the postdiluvian areas of havilah and cush respectively the other two rivers the tigris and euphrates are described as coming from a common source in the garden of eden , certainly far different from their present courses thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of genesis are in harmony with a world wide flood also , it is likely that survivors of the flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the flood , even though the earth 's surface looked entirely different ninth , the duration of the flood makes sense only with a universal flood the deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days \( genesis 7 17 \) , and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the flood began the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months , and the flood waters were not dried up enough for noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed \( see genesis 7 11 8 14 \) such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood tenth , the receding activity of the water \( genesis 8 3a , 54a \) is described by hebrew phrases which , in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the to and fro motion of the raven \( genesis 8 7 \) , should be translated as going and retreating , \( see austin 1990 , p 218 hasel 1978 , p 93 \) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days \( see genesis 8 3 5 \) the waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased , supports a universal interpretation such as the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood \( austin 1990 , p 218 \) , but is incongruous with a local flood theory eleventh , the nt passages concerning the flood all employ universal language swept them all away \( matthew 24 39 \) destroyed them all , \( luke 17 27 \) he did not spare the ancient world , but preserved noah with seven other persons , when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly \( 2 peter 2 5 \) a few , that is eight persons , were saved through water \( 1 peter 3 20 \) noah condemned the world \( hebrews 11 7 \) a local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world as archer states , we have the unequivocal corroboration of the new testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal \( archer 1985 , p 208 \) twelfth , the nt flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity , but also the universality , of the flood to theologically argue for an imminent world wide judgment by fire \( 2 peter 3 6 7 \) peter argues that just as there was a world wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish , so in the antitype there must needs be a universal end time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly \( see davidson 1981 , p 326 327 \) thirteenth , key terms and motifs that we have already noted in genesis 6 9 converge to make a major theological statement the noahic flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the flood narrative nahum sarna writes that the flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation in other words , creation is being undone , and the world returned to chaos \( sarna 1989 , p 48 \) tikva frymer kensky describes the flood as the original , cosmic undoing of creation \( frymer kensky 1983 , p 410 cf frymer kensky 1985 , p 312 \) claus westermann speaks of the invasion of chaos into the created order the flood assumed cosmic proportions \( westermann 1974 1984 , p 434 \) umberto cassuto points out that at the high point of the flood , we see water everywhere , as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of creation , when the waters of the deep submerged everything \( cassuto 1964 , p 97 \) david clines uses the apt term bouleversement or reversal of creation to depict the theological significance of the flood \( clines 1972 , p 136 \) for joseph blenkinsopp , the deluge is an act of uncreation , undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval , watery chaos from which the created order first arose \( blenkinsopp 1992 , p 83 cf blenkinsopp 1971 , p 46 47 \) gerhard von rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation we must understand the flood , therefore , as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos when the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below , and the primeval sea beneath the earth , which is restrained by god , now freed from its bonds , gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth , then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology the two halves of the chaotic primeval sea , separated the one up , the other below by god 's creative government \( ch 1 7 9 \) , are again united creation begins to sink into chaos here the catastrophe , therefore , concerns not only men and beasts but the earth \( chs 6 13 9 1 \) indeed , the entire cosmos \( von rad 1972 , p 128 \) only a cosmic universal flood can theologically encompass the cosmic universal reversal or undoing of creation described in genesis 6 9 fourteenth and last , the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic new beginning as clines states it the 'uncreation' which god has worked with the flood is not final creation has not been permanently undone old unities of the natural world are restored \( 8 22 \) , and the old ordinances of creation are renewed \( 9 1 7 \) \( clines 1972 73 , p 138 \) jacques doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of re creation in the aftermath of the flood \( genesis 8 9 \) and the seven days of creation in genesis 1 2 \( doukhan 1987 , p 133 134 cf gage 1984 , p 10 20 \) the wind over the earth and waters gen 8 1 cf gen 1 2 division of waters gen 8 1 5 cf gen 1 6 8 appearance of plants gen 8 6 12 cf gen 1 9 13 appearance of light gen 8 13 14 cf gen 1 14 19 deliverance of animals gen 8 15 17 cf gen 1 20 23 animals together with men , blessing , food for men , image of god gen 8 18 9 7 cf gen 1 24 31 sign of covenant gen 9 8 17 cf gen 2 1 3 thus in the over arching literary structure of the re creation in the flood narrative , the universal dimension of the flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of genesis 1 2 iv conclusion in conclusion , the question of the extent of the genesis flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for christian faith for those who see the days of creation in genesis 1 as six , literal 24 hour days \( see hasel 1994 \) , a universal flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column a literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world wide flood but a universal flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and scripture it is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of genesis 1 11 and the rest of scripture \( for a more detailed discussion of the theology of the genesis flood in its canonical context , see davidson in press \) the many links with the universal creation in genesis 1 2 which we have noted in this study not only support the aspect of universality in the flood , but serve to theologically connect protology \( creation \) and eschatology \( judgment salvation \) in the opening chapters of scripture the flood is an eschatological step by step uncreation of the world and humanity followed by a step by step re creation of the new world thus , writes von rad , the story of the flood and this is theologically the most important fact shows an eschatological world judgment the world judgment of the flood hangs like an iron curtain between this world age and that of the first splendor of creation \( von rad 1972 , p 129 130 \) the theology of the universal flood is therefore the pivot of a connected but multi faceted universal theme running through genesis 1 11 and constituting an over arching pattern for the entire subsequent world wide creation revealing the character of the creator and his original purpose for creation humankind 's turning from the creator and the universal spread of sin ending in the universal uncreation through eschatological judgment and re creation , in the eschatological salvation of the faithful covenant remnant and the universal renewal of the earth",evolution,1

546@3,"the hidden agenda behind gun storage laws by david kopel in canada and great britain deceitful safe storage laws allow government invasion of gun owners` homes these laws are all part of the gun grabbers` wholesale attack on private gun ownership responsible gun owners store their guns safely for over a century , the national rifle association and other civic groups have done everything they can to encourage safe gun storage partly as a result , the fatal gun accident rate for both kids and adults has fallen to an all time low in spite of this , anti gun politicians , and the anti gun groups are working to turn safe storage into a tool for disarming the american public gun owners who think they have nothing to lose from a government takeover of gun storage should look at what has happened in countries such as canada and great britain there , gun owner apathy has allowed safe storage to become the platform for abolishing gun ownership for home protection , for invading the privacy and the homes of gun owners , and for attacking even the simple possession of firearms great britain british gun owners have a long tradition of going along with government proposals for reasonable restrictions on their rights but as many britons found out too late , a restriction that appears reasonable on paper may become quite unreasonable in practice british law merely mandates that guns be stored in a secure place but britain has a national gun licensing system , similar to the american system proposed by sarah brady of handgun control , inc because most police administrators in britain are intensely opposed to citizens owning guns , they use the storage law to make acquiring a gun license as onerous as possible if you want to obtain or renew a gun license in britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system although the law , even today , does not order guns to be locked in a safe , the police routinely compel gun owners to purchase safes sometimes two safes , the second one for separate storage of ammunition a person buying a low powered l5 rimfire rifle may have to spend 100 on a safe a person with five guns may be ordered to add a 1000 electronic security system one effect of the heavy security costs is to reduce the ability of middle income or poor people to legally own guns , a goal which has been a constant objective of gun control proponents throughout history of course , the requirement that guns be locked in safes makes it nearly impossible for the gun to be used for home protection and the british police establishment despises the idea of defensive gun ownership if you want to obtain or renew a gun license in britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system the requirement that gun owners purchase safes was never democratically enacted by the british parliament rather , the requirement was invented by police administrators , who correctly recognized that any system requiring government permission to buy a gun can be manipulated by anti gun administrators \( similarly , in the united states , police administrators have used the brady act to deny handgun purchases by thousands of people with unpaid traffic tickets or other trivial offenses brady does not formally sanction such abuses , but by requiring government permission for handgun purchases , the act makes such abuses inevitable \) canada in canada , the criminal code prohibits careless storage of a firearm , and gives the government the authority to create storage regulations what does this mean in practice \? consider some cases from 1996 and 1997 hearing suspicious sounds , perhaps from a burglar , a husband took his unloaded rifle with him one night when he looked around his house a few days later , the wife told a friend about the incident aghast , the friend called the police the police arrived at the couple`s home and bullied their way in searching the home , they found the unloaded rifle under a mattress in the bedroom no children lived in the home the couple was charged with careless storage of a firearm a 67 year old single woman ran a small boarding house in ontario a downstairs tenant began harassing and stalking her worried that the woman might pose a threat to the tenant , the police searched her apartment and found several unloaded guns in her closets she was convicted of storage of a firearm in violation of government regulations she had been attending school and studying to become a paralegal , but her conviction will bar her from a job in the legal field recently in winnipeg , a 72 year old woman called a hospital to request that a visiting nurse come over and help her with some medication someone from the hospital asked if the woman had any firearms in the home yes , she replied , my husband has a couple of old hunting rifles down in the rec room the police came over immediately and began searching the home they found several long guns , each with a trigger lock and locked to a rack in the basement they also found a 25 caliber pistol locked in a bedroom closet , which they had broken into the 73 year old husband came home in the middle of the search , and was immediately handcuffed , and accused of being violent other than the fact that he owned guns , there was no evidence that he was violent \( his neighbors later signed statements saying they had known him for years , and he had always been peaceful \) eventually the police removed the handcuffs , and told the man that he had never been under arrest gun storage laws sometimes provide a means for police to justify outrageously bad police work in medicine hat , alberta , a criminal who had charges pending against him tried to buy leniency by claiming that a man named larry davies was a marijuana dealer , with over a pound in his house the medicine hat police did nothing to verify the informant`s claim , other than looking up larry davies` address in the phone book the swat team , apparently having nothing else to do that day , broke into the davies household , and forced larry davies and three friends to the floor , pointing submachine guns at their heads a search of the house revealed mrs davies and her newborn baby , who had come home from the hospital that day four grams of marijuana \( weighing less than a united states 25 cent piece \) and a disassembled fn fal rifle in a basement closet apparently embarrassed but not repentant about the sloppy police practices and wanton show of force , the government charged mr davies with unsafe storage of a firearm happily , a judge threw the charges out of court , noting that whatever mr davies had done was much less of a threat to society than what the police had done and canadian courts have sometimes stopped other abusive prosecutions related to gun storage laws but even then , the victim of the abusive prosecution must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees to avoid a prison sentence of up to two years as david tomlinson , president of canada`s national firearms association , points out , gun storage laws are unenforceable without random police searches of the home canada`s newest gun law , which goes into effect next year , gives the police the authority to inspect private homes to ensure that gun storage laws are being complied with gun storage laws are like laws barring married couples from using birth control they are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home in 1965 , the united states supreme court struck down a birth control ban for this very reason \( griswold v connecticut , 381 u s 479 \( 1965 \) \) for the same reason , privacy minded legislators and citizens should reject turning the government into the home gun storage enforcer former president clinton , by the way , effusively praised the new canadian gun law \( bill c 68 \) which authorizes searches without probable cause small steps gun prohibition almost always moves by incremental steps restrictions that would have seemed outrageous if proposed by themselves can appear reasonable when they merely advance existing restrictions a few more steps gun storage laws are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home in canada , prohibitionists , such as then justice minister alan rock , have used gun storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration , since registration will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe storage laws that are in effect as the next step , the anti gun lobbies in canada have begun pushing for community storage rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home , you would have to keep your guns at a police station when you wanted to use your gun for the day , you could check it out from the police station the anti gun groups point out that a gun in the home could be stolen , or could be misused in a domestic incident there is no reason , they argue , for guns to be kept in a home 365 days a year , when the gun may only be used a few days a year to counter the anti gun groups , gun owners in canada can hardly argue that removing guns from the home makes it impossible to use the guns for home defense they gave up the moral case for self defense years ago by arguing that gun ownership was justified for sporting purposes , but not daring to assert that gun ownership is justified for defensive purposes and by agreeing to safe storage laws , the canadian gun owners gave up the practical ability to use a gun for self defense in a sudden emergency with so much ground already conceded , canadian gun owners are reduced to arguing minor points , such as how a centralized gun storage repository might be more vulnerable to theft even conceding on the community storage issue will do gun owners no good in 1996 , the british parliament banned almost all handguns , but allowed owners of single shot 22s to keep the guns locked in central repositories at gun ranges the new restrictions only briefly sated the appetite of the british anti gun lobbies in 1997 , community storage was replaced by its logical consequence , complete prohibition of all handguns the future who can believe that the right to keep and bear arms could survive community storage , with gun owners needing to ask government bureaucrats for permission to obtain access to their own guns \? who can believe that the american anti gun lobbies , who so consistently imitate the programs of their foreign cousins , will not begin demanding community storage , once they have laid the foundation with safe storage laws \? storing guns safely is the duty of every gun owner what makes for safety depends very much on individual circumstances safety is , and always has been , the concern of organizations such as the national rifle association in the hands of anti gun lobbies and government bureaucrats , though , safe storage becomes an orwellian term designed to negate the many safety benefits of the right to bear arms home safety is the responsibility of the family , not

571@0,"change nobody believes in a bill so reckless that it has to be rammed through on a partisan vote on christmas eve mr obama promised a new era of transparent good government , yet on saturday morning mr reid threw out the 2 , 100 page bill that the world 's greatest deliberative body spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new manager 's amendment that was stapled together in covert partisan negotiations democrats are barely even bothering to pretend to care what 's in it , not that any senator had the chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture vote at 1 a m this morning after procedural motions that allow for no amendments , the final vote could come at 9 p m on december 24 even in world war i there was a christmas truce the rushed , secretive way that a bill this destructive and unpopular is being forced on the country shows that reform has devolved into the raw exercise of political power for the single purpose of permanently expanding the american entitlement state an increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted that no one can truly understand it , as finance chairman max baucus admitted on the floor last week the only goal is to ram it into law while the political window is still open , and clean up the mess later 8226 health costs from the outset , the white house 's core claim was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and businesses , and they 're sticking to that story anyone who says otherwise simply has n't read the bills , mr obama said over the weekend this is so utterly disingenuous that we doubt the president really believes it the best and most rigorous cost analysis was recently released by the insurer wellpoint , which mined its actuarial data in various regional markets to model the senate bill wellpoint found that a healthy 25 year old in milwaukee buying coverage on the individual market will see his costs rise by 178 a small business based in richmond with eight employees in average health will see a 23 increase insurance costs for a 40 year old family with two kids living in indianapolis will pay 106 more and on and on these increases are solely the result of obamacare 8212 above and far beyond the status quo 8212 because its strict restrictions on underwriting and risk pooling would distort insurance markets all but a handful of states have rejected regulations like community rating because they encourage younger and healthier buyers to wait until they need expensive care , increasing costs for everyone benefits and pricing will now be determined by politics as for the white house 's line about cutting costs by eliminating supposed waste , even victor fuchs , an eminent economist generally supportive of obamacare , warned last week that these political theories are overly simplistic the oft heard promise 'we will find out what works and what does not' scarcely does justice to the complexity of medical practice , the stanford professor wrote 8226 steep declines in choice and quality this is all of a piece with the hubris of an administration that thinks it can substitute government planning for market forces in determining where the 33 trillion the u s will spend on medicine over the next decade should go this centralized system means above all fewer choices what works for the political class must work for everyone with formerly private insurers converted into public utilities , for instance , they 'll inevitably be banned from selling products like health savings accounts that encourage more cost conscious decisions unnoticed by the press corps , the congressional budget office argued recently that the senate bill would so substantially reduce flexibility in terms of the types , prices , and number of private sellers of health insurance that companies like wellpoint might need to be considered part of the federal budget with so large a chunk of the economy and medical practice itself in washington 's hands , quality will decline ultimately , our capacity to innovate and develop new therapies would suffer most of all , as harvard medical school dean jeffrey flier recently wrote in our pages take the 2 billion annual tax 8212 rising to 3 billion in 2018 8212 that will be leveled against medical device makers , among the most innovative u s industries democrats believe that more advanced health technologies like mri machines and drug coated stents are driving costs too high , though patients and their physicians might disagree the senate is n't hearing those of us who are closest to the patient and work in the system every day , brent eastman , the chairman of the american college of surgeons , said in a statement for his organization and 18 other speciality societies opposing obamacare for no other reason than ideological animus , doctor owned hospitals will face harsh new limits on their growth and who they 're allowed to treat physician hospitals of america says that obamacare will destroy over 200 of america 's best and safest hospitals 8226 blowing up the federal fisc even though medicare 's unfunded liabilities are already about 2 6 times larger than the entire u s economy in 2008 , democrats are crowing that obamacare will cost only 871 billion over the next decade while fantastically reducing the deficit by 132 billion , according to cbo yet some 98 of the total cost comes after 2014 8212 remind us why there must absolutely be a vote this week 8212 and most of the taxes start in 2010 that includes the payroll tax increase for individuals earning more than 200 , 000 that rose to 0 9 from 0 5 percentage points in mr reid 's final machinations job creation , here we come other deceptions include a new entitlement for long term care that starts collecting premiums tomorrow but does n't start paying benefits until late in the decade but the worst is not accounting for a formula that automatically slashes medicare payments to doctors by 21 5 next year and deeper after that everyone knows the payment cuts wo n't happen but they remain in the bill to make the cost look lower the american medical association 's priority was eliminating this sustainable growth rate but all they got in return for their year of obamacare cheerleading was a two month patch snuck into the defense bill that passed over the weekend the truth is that no one really knows how much obamacare will cost because its assumptions on paper are so unrealistic to hide the cost increases created by other parts of the bill and transfer them onto the federal balance sheet , the senate sets up government run exchanges that will subsidize insurance for those earning up to 400 of the poverty level , or 96 , 000 for a family of four in 2016 supposedly they would only be offered to those whose employers do n't provide insurance or work for small businesses as eugene steuerle of the left leaning urban institute points out , this system would treat two workers with the same total compensation 8212 whatever the mix of cash wages and benefits 8212 very differently under the senate bill , someone who earned 42 , 000 would get 5 , 749 from the current tax exclusion for employer sponsored coverage but 12 , 750 in the exchange a worker making 60 , 000 would get 8 , 310 in the exchanges but only 3 , 758 in the current system for this reason mr steuerle concludes that the senate bill is not just a new health system but also a new welfare and tax system that will warp the labor market given the incentives of these two tier subsidies , employers with large numbers of lower wage workers like wal mart may well convert them into contractors or do more outsourcing as more and more people flood into free health care , taxpayer costs will explode a reckless health care bill that nobody believes in wsj com","under then bill pushed through in the middle of the night 1 a healthy 25 year old in milwaukee will see his costs rise by 178 2 a small business in richmond with eight employees will see a 23 increase 3 insurance for a 40 year old family with two kids in indianapolis will pay 106 more 4 collection of payroll taxes for the new plan will begin jan 2010 , but benefits do n't start until 2014 5 payment to doctors for medicare patients will decrease 21 5 next year and more after that how many doctors do you think will continue to treat medicare patients when that happens \? 6 the plan will cost 871billion over the next decate , but 98 of the cost occurs after 2014 7 medical device manufacturers pay 2billion year in taxes this will rise to 3billion year in 2018 , removing 1billion that could be used for r amp d and adding it to the cost of current devices instead 8 the rest of the country will pay all of nebraska 's state contributions to medicare forever because that was the bribe that the democrats made for the 60th vote now , cake lady , prove me wrong !",healthcare,1

the hole is that inheritance of new traits is not necessary for evolution in other words , populational evolution does not require traits to be passed on this mantra is a giant straw man , as you will soon see , because much if not all of what we see in the field is merely a matter of environmental evolution the reality is that a change in phenotype is observed as evolution in the field and in the fossil record but there is no way to tell from the fossils or from non controlled scientific experiments whether new traits are caused by variation arising in the genotype or only from environmental effects acting on the phenotype not only that , but theres also no way to tell without close inspection if these traits are inherited or acquired its well known that animal embryo development brings about a collaboration between the genetic program , internal signals from the mother , and external signals from the environment somehow the embryo processes this information and emerges accordingly therefore , the same genome can emerge with different phenotypes depending on environment or external circumstance this is known as differentiation , and is simply the convergence of an organisms genes and environment during development moths and butterflies are perfect example of this phenomenon as well , tadpoles can not only change the size and shape of their heads , it 's also known that the presence of predators can influence their tail size , shape , color , hatch times and general size of the organism \( could this be why neanderthals had their brow ridges \? since they had a slightly protruding face \( as many in europe still do \) , the exertion that no doubt came from eating a diet heavy in meat \( vigorous chewing \) could very well have put pressure on the facial plates and brow ridges and as youngsters with soft bones , this diet help dictate their morphology \) but its not just tadpoles as well , rodents , will dine on a variety of seeds and nutsas youngsters , if a population of mice come across a new food supply , they are all likely to all develop a morphology that suits such a diet if this food is different than what their parents ate , their morphology could be uniquely different than their parents this new morphology would follow them until adulthood if the food supply stuck around long enough time , it could give the appearance that the population was evolving but genetics would have nothing to do with it instead , it would simply be a cultural , environmental phenomenon its an environmental evolution , of sorts of course this leaves natural selection out of a job because the entire population would be evolving new , beneficial morphologies without it not only that but it bypasses the ridiculous premise that science has constructed for itself which says that new , beneficial traits have to be passed on this is a bogus premise from the very start because its not necessary for traits to be passed on for new morphologies to carry forward into future generations all that 's needed is , in this case , for a specific diet to continue to be available to future generations which , of course , would carry on those particular traits we think licking affects a methylation enzyme that is ready and waiting for mother to start licking , dr meaney said in perilous times , mothers may be able to set the stress reactivity of their offspring by licking less when there are fewer dangers around , the mothers may lick more color really the skys the limit diet , terrain , movement , predators , weather , availability of resources , etc life is not about genes , life is about life the designer didnt create animals adapted to specific environments , he created them with an adaptive ability to evolve with a changing environment this is not evolution its an adaptive response of course , some say new beak shapes could have formed during development , but either way , selection is not required it would be similar situation to the butterfly example i gave above this of course , is just another example where it is not necessary for traits to be passed on traits need not be passed on to give the illusion of populational evolution and whats interesting is goulds explanation for why lamarckism is false this is very interesting and ties in directly to this of course , gould has set up a giant straw man that has been repeated relentlessly the straw man is that it 's not necessary pass on traits , for the reasons stated above and it is not necessary that environments or acquired adaptations can direct sex cells to mutate in specific directions life gets around that little scenario because each life is individually adaptive and adaptations start during development where his eyes could n't see or did n't want to life changes so rapidly if you blink you miss it ! stephen , i know youre dead , but if you can somehow hear me , please note you have made a great error you have a giant hole in your theory , which i have just exploited its called the environmental evolution revolution not only have i undercut your snails but i 've undercut most of what you and all your foolish friends say in your books evolution surely has a heritable component , but a huge portion of what is perceived as evolution in the field is not that at all it 's merely an illusion and upon close inspection it disappears altogether just like your theory you see , there is no evidence for natural selection sifting through random mutations what is seen in the field today is not evidence for that , it 's simply evidence that the environment is working on the genetic code of each creature",this is a very interesting post you show a lot of knowledge and insight it is quite long and i do n't think i understood all of it could you mention what is the most important point \?

as owen has remarked , the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals , will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat , used as they are for such totally different purposes \? why should one crustacean , which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts , consequently always have fewer legs or conversely , those with many legs have simpler mouths \? why should the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils in any individual flower , though fitted for such widely different purposes , be all constructed on the same pattern \? on the theory of natural selection , we can satisfactorily answer these questions homology was a pre darwinian idea with the term coined by owen who rather despised darwin and his ideas darwin tries to argue why a designer would not use the same for the same function he says homology is evidence of an unwise design the premise is a creator would n't be so inefficient but , unless one has a handle on the teleological goal , one is free to fabricate all manner of bad design arguments \( for example read write errors in audio cd 's or fuel inefficient cars \) the biotic message theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one designer and author of life , and that life could not have evolved like a great novel , the imperfections of biology are part of a larger plot it is turning out , darwin 's argument from homology is a concept in crisis",evolution,1

648@1,"the one with the common law but since you do n't have common sense , you probably never hoid of it ignorance of a contract 's obvious terms is never an excuse from being bound by them , once one consents to those legal and binding terms via accepting consideration \( i e engaging in sexual congress as you put it \) and if men think that sexual intercourse with a fertile woman does n't involve the risk of pregnancy , they 're inexcusably ignorant like you this creates an implied in fact contract between the the man and the woman , with the party conceived being beneficiary and subject thereto \( i e parental rights over the child etc \) those are the clear and obvious terms , and therefore sexual intercourse is a contingency agreement between the couple doing the coupling , and any potential offspring resulting therefrom if they do n't like the terms , they can act to reduce the chances , or avoid the contract entirely through simply abstaining from the agreemetn but they ca n't pact for the wrongful death of the unwitting third party , in order for their own personal benefit at that child 's expense freedom is not carte blanche to do as one pleases , but only in a manner exclusive of the rights of others and so social contracts are not not strictly about what you want , it 's about what you consent to whether by your actions or words consistent with those rights of everyone , whether pre or post natal a woman 's body is not another country , let alone another universe the price of freedom is n't eternal vigilance it 's responsibility to others , for what you choose do with that freedom","though i am jumping into the discussion here and have not followed it from the beginning , i need to address yours points i get the impression that you view women as having a responsibility over their offspring from the point of conception on i e not only in late term i would contest this up to around the beginning of the third trimester , the embryo fetus is nothing but a developing body with nobody home i e no mental existence \( no thoughts , no emotions , no sense of self , no feelings of pain , no ability to experience their environment nothing \) i do not see any reason to have forced responsibility over such a living mindless body as at the end of life when the mind can be gone from accident or illness , it is not worth keeping the empty living body artificially alive it is the person who effectively resides in the body \( through mental brain function or belief in a soul \) who we value not the body itself from discussions with those on the pro life side , it seems clear that the thing that is valued in the embryo early fetus is not as much what it currently is but what it will become what it currently is is only valued because it is on its way to becoming something someone that we do value the hypothetical question to test this was how much is such a life valued if it suddenly stopped growing so that it would never reach the stage of lifeform that has emotions , thoughts , feelings of pain , etc apparently , its value dropped significantly \( at least that was the answer for those not afraid of anwering that question \) however , once there is somebody home in that body , then i would agree that you now have another person whose rights should be taken into account biologically , neurologically speaking , such mental functions ca n't start before around the beginning of the third trimester so , i support more clearly legally restricting third trimester abortion rights to the limited exceptions \( mother 's life , significant risk to health , mercy killing deformed fetuses , etc \) then it makes sense to speak of an other to whom one has responsibilities one last point i have heard a few pro life advocates make the same arguement you do that pro choice supporters make their arguements simply out of a defense rationalization , where you think they really do agree that they are doing wrong you do n't realize that they actually generally do believe all of what they say as a general rule of thumb , i tend to think that most people believe what they say however , many people have holes or inconsistencies in their thinking that one can highlight if one can tell what those holes or inconsistencies are i have found that the best way to discover such holes and inconsistencies in reasoning is to see what type of questions people make an effort at avoiding to answer where the pro life camp is concerned , i find that a major hole in their reasoning is to highlight what the embryo early fetus is at that moment , independent of what it will become in the future this has highlighted that it is only valued by what it will become , not for what it currently is as for the extreme pro choice side that would allow abortions at all times for any reason \( note they represent a minority of the pro choice side \) , then they get very uncomfortable when you question them about the difference in a fetus one day from birth vs a newborn baby and force them to answer the question of whether or not they would allow a birth minus one day abortion for any reason so , instead of jumping to wrong assumptions about the reasoning of pro choice supporters , search for holes in logic and reasoning that you can exploit that would be far more effective than your false assumptions

726@0,i am aware of that i am just having trouble reconciling the idea of removing a fundamental right based on a misdemeanor conviction and was wondering if there is similar precedent elsewhere,"i agree with you to some extent first , the mr hayes was convicted of this crime before the lautenberg amendment was passed secondly , virginian law \( where the case originates from \) makes no distinction between a domestic relationship \( that which he was tried and convicted of \) and between the agressor quote majority ruling a domestic relationship , although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a 922 \( g \) \( 9 \) firearms possession prosecution , need not be a defining element of the predicate offense pp 413 bulldung if congress wanted to make it simpler they would have just said battery instead of domestic violence how the heck they came up with that is beyond me they basically expanded the meaning of the lautenberg amendment , which is a big no no ! i think that is what justice roberts was saying in his dissent quote justice roberts dissent that reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause \( ii \) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute individuals convicted under generic use of force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would there fore be subject to prosecution under 922 \( g \) \( 9 \) the majority also points out that interpreting commit ted by to modify the use of force would render the wordcommitted superfluous that may be so , but as shown , reading committed by to modify offense has its own flaws all this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading the majority properly acknowledges that , under its view , the statutory language reflects less than meticulous drafting and syntactical awkwardness , and is not a model of the careful drafters art ante , at 6 , 12 , 13 i am willing to acknowledge the same with respect to my reading but i conclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least ambiguous which is why this law needs to be rewritten there is a lot more , but i find the majority decision hard to believe it just does n't make sense \( well to me that is \) btw , this by no means i support domestic violent offenders , etc on the contrary , i believe they should lose their gun rights if convicted of domestic violence , but , this decision is wrong the pieces do not fit together that is mr hayes was convicted of battery , not domestic violence the government screwed up , so he should be walking free right now",gun control,1

727@1,"the fear on the street is palpable ever since the election of barack obama as president of these united states in november 2008 , coupled with the election of a democrat party majority in both the u s house and senate , concern for the united states and personal safety has ignited like a fire in dry grass snip what is odd about this new fear is that it is not coming from the average citizen gun owner out there , but it is coming from what to me is an almost shocking source street cops street cops and swat cops that i know from various agencies rural , suburban and metro in my area are scared cops that before november 2008 never gave much thought \( that i knew of anyway \) to politics or more importantly to gun rights for the most part , these are the guys that didnt generally have any interest in shooting or gun ownership beyond keeping track of where their duty gun is , and a few of them didnt even do that so well the guys i am talking about now are some of the same guys who used to not even carry off duty on a regular basis but not anymore they dont scare easily , defenders of the constitution of this state and the united states \( as our oath of office reads \) , have been buying ars , survival gear , and all the ammo they can lay their hands on all of them \( or i should say us \) have been discussing and have been acquiring guns to provide a layered perimeter defense what are we suddenly so afraid of \? well in our discussions it seems to boil down to four areas first , fear of federal government intrusion into our lives every time i look at or listen to the news , there is something new and intrusive coming out of the obama administration and this congress new tax schemes , government run canadian style healthcare , a volunteer citizen defense force \( whatever that is , what happened to the national guard \? \) equipped with funding similar to our military , forced voluntary service after retirement , a lack of a southern border with hordes of illegal and criminal aliens pouring over our border , the swine flu scare as well as government forced closing of thousands of privately held chrysler and gm dealerships , which will be the final nail in the coffin for these companies and the list goes on and on but these items in the news are just the tip of the iceberg we cant see the full impact of these actions yet , but we dont know what was added into the thousand of pages of stimulus package bills in the dead of night yet i predict however that when the plans contained in the stimulus packages go into effect , a lot of us are going to be surprised if not shocked by what has suddenly and sweepingly changed what also scares us is the second , well founded fear that there is an assault weapons ban looming , one that would make the clinton ban appear like a look of disdain in comparison i remember well the 1990s and the clinton years the rise of militia groups , the black helicopter rumors and paranoia , all of which was motivated by the brady law and the assault weapons ban what if a new ban comes requiring registration or confiscation and turn in of banned weapons as what happened in australia \? i foresee much civil disobedience coming down the road americans are citizens , and not subjects like the british , canadians or australians they just dont always obey the law blindly and not one officer or citizen that i spoke to said anything like i hope i get to keep this gun for awhile before they are banned they are fun to shoot , so i would hate to give it up it isnt going to happen , so the cop on the street and the soldier on the base needs to think now what he will do if the orders come down i think you all get what i am saying here which leads me to the third fear , that there is a revolution coming , yes , a revolution on the scale of the original american revolution you can hear this topic discussed on many of the talk radio shows by even the big name hosts the possibility of an armed revolution against the u s government being discussed , albeit very gingerly and fleetingly and as something to be avoided , which it is i never heard this mentioned in the 90s one of my quietest , low profile officer friends brought it up the other day he said that at some point in the near future , he felt there is going to be an armed revolt if things keep going the way they are something has got to give i was shocked yes , i had heard this from some of my more radical cop friends in the past , but to hear it from a guy like this was unprecedented now , these guys are not saying this will happen to foment revolution , preach sedition or to even participate they just want to be ready if it happens , to at least defend their families , because number four on the fear list is general societal chaos cops fear for their parents , wives , children or grandchildren more now than ever before most cops are encouraging their spouses and loved ones to get concealed carry permits not only that , but some of these same cops are buying gun mounts for their personal cars so they can carry an ar in the family ride at the ready all the time they are also strapping on heavier forms of off duty hardware i have other friends that are issued ars or subguns for tactical team use , who always have their gear with them and are planning on just commandeering these weapons for personal use in defending hearth and home final notes this is pretty heady and maybe even dangerous stuff know fully that i am not advocating anything here i am reflecting to you what i see and hear going on around me , and maybe saying things that havent been said in the open , until now it is something to think about","to our fellow americans on the left think carefully before you overplay your cards ! but what do i know i am just a dumb hillbilly pickup driving , dumb bunny !",gun control,0

750@0,"under these circumstances stress induced hyper mutation , as per eam , above , it has been repeatedly demonstrated since 1988 , at corning , by that scientist whose name escapes me that the number of adaptive mutations outnumbers the number of of ineffectual or maladaptive mutations by a strongly significant statistical percentage","on the face of it , the implication is that this kind of thing happens all the time that everywhere you look , stress induced hypermutation is occurring , and along with it adaptive mutations are occurring disproportionately often that this is part and parcel of everyday evolution the ardour with which this evidence is brandished is , however , misleading in only a handful of studies , using specific strains of bacteria with specific genetic features under specific environmental circumstances , have specific adaptive mutations seemed to occur with anomalous frequency there is no suggestion that these cases are in any way generally representative , and even if the results were being interpreted correctly , the idea that they constitute evidence for a pan species mechanism of internally directed evolution is , unfortunately , wishful thinking but what of these rare anomalous cases \? the most famous was reported by j cairns and p l foster , in which a dish of starving , non growing e coli \( a particular strain with a lac mutation \) appeared to preferentially induce a reversion mutation \( to lac \) in order to enable growth when the only source of energy was lactose moreover , the mutation did not occur with such frequency if lactose was not present , if there was another growth inhibiting factor in play , or if food sources other than lactose were available on top of that , although the adapted bacteria showed evidence of accumulating other non selected mutations , it was nowhere near enough to explain the rate of adaptive mutation , and the bacteria which did n't adapt showed no accumulation of unselected mutations at all ! understandably , this looked to them , and other people at the time , like a pretty cut'n 'dried example of an environmentally or organismically induced adaptive mutation however , the nagging problem remained that this event was completely unprecedented , and was not observed in the general case of bacteria under starvation conditions why was this strain of bacteria so good at inducing this particular reversion mutation in just those circumstances \? the answer , as it turned out , was that the experimental assumption of 'no growth' taking place in the e coli colony was in error the strain of e coli used in the experiment had a 'leaky' \( inefficient \) mutant lac allele , with only 1 to 2 of the normal ability to process lactose that 1 to 2 was then deliberately 'smothered' by the experimenters through the addition of scavenger cells which mopped up the product of what little lactose the e coli could process , effectively halting their growth because the later , visible growing colonies of e coli had a reversion mutation to lac , the experimenters deduced that mutation was required for growth to be possible however , what they did not take into account at the time was that during normal growth prior to incubation on the test medium , a small proportion of the e coli colony experienced a duplication of the leaky lac gene this mutation conferred no advantage until the colony was plated on lactose now , the second copy of the gene increased the total amount of lactose they could process beyond the ability of the scavenger cells to inhibit growth , and the e coli could \( slowly \) grow and divide within these slow growing microcolonies , selection favoured those cells which experienced further lac duplications and the more lac duplications a cell has , the more likely one of them will experience a reversion mutation to lac , explaining the apparently anomalous frequency of that particular mutation when this happens , cell growth rate jumps considerably but now it is the additional lac genes which are holding the organism back , destabilising the chromosome and tying up resources which could be more efficiently processed by the lac gene selection now favours those lac revertants who lose the unstable lac duplications by the time the microcolonies become visible to the naked eye , they consist almost entirely of lac revertants this hypothesis agrees with all observations related to the earlier experiments , and was verified in a number of ways , including repeating the experiment with a colony composed entirely of duplicate lac bacteria , increasing the number of microcolonies 100 fold , which tallies with the 1 background rate of chromosomal duplications in those bacteria also , bacteria in the late arriving microcolonies were observed to possess residual duplicate lac genes in short , the results of the experiment agree completely with classical evolutionary theory it should be noted , by the way , that in addition to the late arriving 'directed mutation' microcolonies that causes such a stir , the original experimenters also observed the expected number of early appearing colonies from pre plating revertant mutants , a la l amp d edit reading further around the subject , it seems no stress induced hypermutable state was involved either apparently , 10 20 of the bacteria with lac duplications also possessed 'dinb' \( a mutation promoting gene apparently , though it 's beyond the scope of my research here \) on the same plasmid the mutagen 'came along for the ride' so to speak , as selection favoured the duplication of that section of dna , and induced hgher rates of mutation in yep 10 20 of the adaptive population so not only was the hypermutational state of that subpopulation not the cause of the adaptive mutation \( clearly , since the other 80 90 of adaptation happened without it \) , it was actually harmful live n learn ! 2nd edit the same experiment yields similar results with lac situated within the chromosome itself , only with 100 fold fewer colonies , reflecting the lower incidence of chromosomal duplication and reversion events in comparison with plasmids",evolution,1

760@6,"a lot of garbage has been bandied about concerning the emotional trauma a woman suffers after she has had an abortion there is no substantive , unbiased research on this topic but a cursory sampling seems to indicate that women who report great emotional trauma after an abortion were already mentally unbalanced , possibly subject to depression or dramatic mood swings or other mental disturbances prior to becoming pregnant and having an abortion i am inclined to believe that such emotionally disturbed women are incapable of making a rational choice in many instances and they probably would have suffered enormous emotional consequences whatever choice they made but , if one could survey a sizable group of women who were in command of their faculties and capable of making good and reasonable choices , what if these women experienced emotional trauma and greatly regretted their decisions my first question to them would be , why exactly did you choose abortion \? i would like to know if they were forced by poverty to make such a choice , thereby not having a free choice or , if they were forced because of the stigma against unwed motherhood and illegitimate birth , particularly if they came from a very religious household , to have an abortion to avoid shame both for themselves and for their families again , not a free choice another factor would be if a woman were pursuing a very desired career and having a child or being disabled by pregnancy would injure her professional prospects the workplace does not look kindly upon the demands of pregnancy , giving birth , being responsible for children america is not a very family friendly nation and women who are responsible for the primary care of children are severely penalized for having those responsibilities again , these women do not have a free choice in the matter","just to provide some evidence of how incredibly shallow your liberal justifications and imaginings are , here 's some light reading for you simone it 's from something called a book chapter 9 health more specifically , mental health in discussing abortion , and abortion for the mothers health , it is absolutely crucial to know what health means , legally and in practice , regarding abortion health was defined in detail by the u s supreme court the court said that abortion could be performed in the light of all factors physical , emotion al , psychological , familial , and the womans age relevant to the well being of the patient all these factors may relate to health roe vs wade , january 22 , 1973 and in its companion decision , maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a distressful life and future psychological harm may be imminent mental and physical health may be taxed by childcare there is also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted child , and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable , psychologically or otherwise , to care for it doe vs bolton , january 22 , 1973 44 in a concurring opinion , justice douglas further elaborated what health meant when , in law , it related to abortion he detailed if she had to endure the discomforts of pregnancy to incur the pain , higher mortality rate , and aftereffects of childbirth to abandon educational plans to sustain loss of income to forego the satisfactions of careers to tax further mental and physical health in providing childcare , and in some cases , to bear the lifelong stigma of unwed motherhood roe vs wade , january 22 , 1973 this definition of health has been adopted internationally as a result , in any nation , if abortion is al lowed for the womans health , that country permits abortion on demand unless other aspects of its laws add restrictions the world health organization of the united nations defined it as including social , emotional and economic well being of the woman as defined by the woman herself lets narrow it down to mental health , in the psychological sense , and askare there mental health reasons for abortion \? no ! the woman with mental health problems is far more likely to experience post abortion emotional and psychological problems than a more stable woman four classic references here are these women with a history of psychiatric disturbance were three times as likely to have some psychiatric disturbance after an abortion as others who had no such history e greenglass , abortion amp psychiatric disturbance , canadian psych assn jour , vol 21 , no 7 , nov 1976 , pp 453 459 dr charles ford and his associates at ucla reported the same finding the more serious the psychiatric diagnosis , the less beneficial was the abortion c ford et al , abortion , is it a therapeutic procedure in psychiatry \?

precisely what about psychological problems after abortion \? when your authors wrote handbook on abortion in 1971 , there were a few murmurings about post abortion problems , but little was known we then saw the negatives as mostly physical when we wrote abortion questions amp answers in 1985 , physical damage , while still a major problem , was given less emphasis , and negative psychological aftermath was being seriously investigated with the publication of this book , far more is known about what is now called post abortion syndrome which clearly is a post traumatic stress syndrome a post traumatic stress syndrome \? yes this type of problem was first seen in large numbers in vietnam veterans , but did not manifest it self until a decade after they returned the same ten year delay has been evident with abortion t keane , vietnam vets trauma disorder level at 15 , am med news , l abraham , dec 2 , 1988 , p 2 what is post abortion syndrome \( pas \) \? many women are very ambivalent about getting aborted but do go ahead those around her told her \( and she told herself \) that it wouldnt bother her when symptoms occur , she tells herself it cant be the abortion causing them , and then into play come her two major psychological defense mechanisms repression and denial for some this works successfully for others it shades off to manageable distress , to severe and life changing upset and even to suicide there is a delay \? yes ! her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief then , with repression and denial , she avoids the problem , usually for years 5 years is common , 10 or 20 not unusual but then , for some , the negative feelings bubble up and break through often the precipitating event is she has a baby , or a close friend or relative has a baby that she has close contact with she finds out she is sterile , or other life changing events what are the symptoms of pas \? guilt is ever present in many guises , along with regret , remorse , shame , lowered self esteem , insomnia , dreams and nightmares , flash backs , anniversary reactions there often is hostility , and even hatred , toward men this can include her husband , and she may be come sexually dysfunctional crying , despair and depression are usual , even at times with suicide attempts recourse to alcohol or drugs to mask the pain is frequent , sometimes leading to sexual promiscuity there is also a numbing and coldness in place of more normal warmth and maternal tenderness is this due to religious guilt feelings \? perhaps in some it is a factor , but most women re ported on in the early studies were unchurched at the time perhaps they had seen pictures of fetuses \? again , not most most did not know it was a baby when they aborted but ive heard that the american psychological association says that pas doesnt exist this group has been strongly pro abortion , and this definitely colors its thinking but during the past decade or more , there have been dozens of national conferences on pas there are many professional articles and about 15 books adding more and more authentication to its existence and knowledge about it further , every one of the almost 4 , 000 pro life pregnancy help centers in the u s now has found that an increasing percentage of their time is now devoted to treating pas women but so many studies deny pas true , and most are invalid for two reasons \( 1 \) timing most studies have investigated feelings for only a few weeks or months post abortion when she is still feeling relief that her problem is gone since the delay before pas symptoms intrude is often 5 years or more , these studies are invalid \( 2 \) superficiality her repression and denial push this deep into her subconsciousness if the survey is done by questionnaire or single interview , she routinely denies problems these studies are invalid only by lengthy psychological testing and counseling can she often admit to some symptoms , much less tie them to the abortion she so desperately wants to forget you mean most studies miss pas \? but most polls show few emotional problems only a sense of relief ! yes , but what women really feel at the deepest level about abortion is very different from what they say in reply to questionnaires a canadian study polled a group of women who had previously completed a questionnaire in which they denied having problems from an abortion one half of this group was randomly chosen for in depth psychotherapy what emerged from psychotherapy was in sharp contrast to the questionnaires , even when the woman had rationally considered abortion to be inevitable , the only course of action it was demonstrated that the conscious , rationalized decision for an abortion can co exist with profound rejection of it at the deepest level despite surface appearances , abortion leaves behind deeper feelings invariably of intense pain , involving bereavement and a sense of identification with the foetus i kent et al , emotional sequelae of elective abortion , british college of med jour , vol 20 , no 4 , april 1978 i kent , abortion has profound impact , family practice news , june 1980 , p 80 are there valid studies \?

suicide is rare among pregnant women , but much more common after induced abortion it is never re ported under maternal mortality from abortion , of course , even though it is causative the suicide rate after an abortion was three times the general suicide rate and six times that associated with birth the rate for women following a live birth was 5 9 per 100 , 000 following miscarriage 18 1 following abortion 34 7 they note that women frequently get short term post natal blues after having a baby , but that this rarely translates into suicide , and that the initial stress of having a child is transitional , the over all effect having a positive effect on womens health m gissler , abortion suicide link , br med j , dec 6 , 1996 then it is rare among pregnant women \?

lynn m paltrow , executive director of national advocates for pregnant women sums it up quite well in 1984 , south carolina 's supreme court created a state feticide law in a case where a man viciously stabbed his pregnant girlfriend , causing her , among other things , to lose her pregnancy in 1997 , south carolina used this law against a pregnant woman , cornelia whitner , who was charged with failing to provide proper medical care for her unborn child whitner had given birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for an illegal drug based on extrapolation of the state feticide law , ms whitner was convicted of criminal child abuse at sentencing ms whitner begged for drug treatment the judge responded , i think i 'll just let her go to jail regina mcknight was an indigent 22 year old woman with a drug problem she became pregnant and despite her problems had every hope of carrying her pregnancy to term , but the pregnancy ended in stillbirth the hospital reacted not by offering her counseling or drug treatment , but rather by helping build a criminal case against her eventually she was convicted of murder the south carolina medical association and other leading health groups concluded that there was no evidence that mcknight 's drug use caused the stillbirth moreover , no one in this case , not even the prosecution , believed that mcknight had any intention of harming the fetus or losing the pregnancy had mcknight intentionally sought to end her pregnancy by having an illegal third trimester abortion , her sentence would have been two years in jail but because of a law similar to the bill president bush just signed , she is today serving a 12 year sentence read more here another good article on the matter do pregnant woman have rights \? in 1984 , for example , a nigerian woman pregnant and hospitalized in chicago was forced to have a c section she refused the surgery because she planned to return to nigeria where she would be unable to access c sections for future births the hospital obtained a court order and forced her to undergo the procedure hospital staff tied her down with leather wrist and ankle cuffs while she screamed for help another hospital obtained a court order to force a pregnant woman to undergo a blood transfusion doctors yelled at and forcibly restrained , overpowered and sedated the woman in order to carry out the order in washington , dc , doctors sought a court order to force ayesha madyun to have a c section the doctors asserted that the fetus faced a 50 75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically the court , apparently viewing the pregnant woman as having no more rights than a slab of meat , said , a ll that stood between the madyun fetus and its independent existence , separate from its mother , was put simply , a doctor 's scalpel with that , the court granted the order and the scalpel sliced through ms madyun 's flesh , the muscles of her abdominal wall , and her uterus when the procedure was done , there was no evidence of infection angela carder at 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant became critically ill she , her family and her attending physicians all agreed on treatment designed to keep her alive for as long as possible the hospital however called an emergency hearing to determine the rights of the fetus despite testimony that a cesarean section could kill ms carder , the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal rights as a result , ms carder not only lost her right to informed consent and bodily integrity she lost her life the surgery resulted in the death of both angela and her fetus all of these women were denied the right to bodily integrity and physical liberty and their fetuses were granted more rights than any legal person under law that line just about sums it up these laws are n't about saving the unborn , and neither is the pro life movement it is about controlling and punishing pregnant woman it is about taking rights away from the woman the moment of conception as if she no longer exists these people would not think twice about prosecuting a pregnant woman whos pregnancy results in misscarriage intentional , accidental , whatever",abortion,1

' twenty three percent \( 23 \) said yes in that same month \( may 2000 \) , a gallup national random digit dial survey asked 'not including military combat , have you ever used a gun to defend yourself either by firing it or threatening to fire it \?

842@4,"the recent confiscation of a formerly legal firearm has raised questions about how the rcmp inspects imported firearms and has forced a change of national firearms policy the rcmp will be physically checking every assault style rifle that enters the country from now on before the change , verifiers were used to check to make sure the guns are what the exporter said they would be verifiers could be anyone with knowledge of firearms and were given a one day course from the rcmp businesses that sell weapons were able to nominate their own verifiers but the discovery of a gun the rcmp says should never have made it into canada has highlighted potential problems with the verifier program there is concern that the first loyalty of business verifiers is to the business and that this could hurt the accuracy of the verifications we 've identified an issue with the program , said marty cheliak , the director general of the canadian firearms program there 's a perception of a conflict of interest that may be prevalent in this case , we 're looking into that for sure cheliak was referring to the case of the norinco type 97a rifle sixty of the chinese made guns were imported between december 2006 and november 2007 they were initially classified as restricted , based on information from the importer , photos , specifications from the manufacturer and an inspection by a business nominated verifier in october 2009 , the canada border services agency alerted the rcmp to a second shipment this time the rifles were given a full physical inspection by the rcmp , which determined the rifles should be prohibited why did they make a mistake \? asked blair hagen , president of the national firearms association if the rcmp made the mistake in the first place , that has some very serious ramifications in march , the rcmp sent letters to owners of the norinco type 97a rifles , demanding they turn in the guns this came after the rcmp decided the gun was prohibited after determining it could be easily converted to fully automatic fire it was a purpose built fully automatic firearm with the fully automatic features disabled by norinco which were not reported to us , cheliak said it is very easily converted back to automatic automatic weapons , even those converted to semi automatic fire , are prohibited in canada guns that can be easily converted to fully automatic fire are also prohibited the firearms association believes the gun was illegally reclassified , and some members plan to go to court to fight the seizures the nfa is very concerned about the rcmp 's unilateral reclassification of this particular firearm and believes there should be a more transparent process in place to explain it , hagen said apparently , they 've done a report on this however , they 've refused to release that report i think what 's required here is some transparency they should demonstrate that to the owners and to the firearms community , so that everyone knows the truth and we can make a determination if the classification was indeed legitimate cheliak suggested the process is transparent enough why would we , the rcmp , or any police service give out information to any group 8230 on how to convert a firearm from semi automatic to fully automatic \? that 's ludicrous hagen said owners are simply looking for proof he does not believe that if owners knew how to convert their weapons to fully automatic they would do so that quest for proof will be part of the owners' fight in court , where they are questioning the rcmp 's ability to reclassify the weapons hagen said his understanding of the law is that only the federal cabinet can initiate a reclassification however , cheliak said he does n't believe the weapon has actually been reclassified , but classified for the first time a proper classification was done with the physical inspection of the firearm collection of the weapons began in early may the rcmp say about half of the rifles have been turned in those who turned over their weapons were eligible for reimbursement from the ministry of public safety , which is rare public safety minister vic toews issued a written statement supporting the rcmp 's efforts to retrieve the firearms and saying the authorization of compensation balances the need for public safety with the legitimate expectations of firearms owners hagen , of the national firearms association , says the rcmp have put the conservative government , a longtime supporter of the rights of gun owners , in an awkward position for now , the owners do n't feel the government has turned its back on them however , as this issue progresses , it is going to raise a lot of questions with the minister and inside the government , and i think the minister needs to be prepared for that","so it 's just as we 've said registration can and does lead to confiscation down the line and now we have further proof that we 're right about what we say government gets the weapon registered , then they can , at any time and for any reason , demand it be surrendered to the authorities or else punishment will be administered",gun control,1

848@4,"the mexican ambassador to the united states , auturo sarukhan , appeared on a cbs news program recently and repeated a lie we have heard for many months about the violence in mexico the ambassador says americans are to blame for the violence wrecked on his country by the mexican drug cartels because most of the guns confiscated by mexican police can be traced back to the united states that is not true , but the way that claim has been accepted by american politicians and the mainstream media raises suspicions about a hidden agenda atfes fake number we can almost forgive the mexican ambassador for being confused when the united states agency responsible for enforcing our gun laws , the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives , has made so many contradictory statements on the matter atfe assistant director william hoover told congress last year that 90 of the weapons seized in mexico crime scenes can be traced to gun sales in the us the problem is that 90 number is n't true yet , that has n't kept it from being picked up and used by members of congress , secretary of state hillary clinton , and , of course , mexican officials like ambassador sarukhan who are eager to blame the us for mexicos problems real weapons source \? the 90 number reported by hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the u s for tracing , but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by mexican authorities a spokesman for the atfe , matt allen , has now clarified the number and admitted that only 17 of the weapons found at crime scenes in mexico have been traced to the u s ironically , while mexican officials have freely used the 90 number from the atfe , they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers the truth is , they know better we can easily understand mexico 's reasons for preferring the 90 number to the more accurate 17 mexico does not want to openly discuss the many other sources of advanced weapons being used by the drug cartels thousands of advanced weapons and tons of military equipment are stolen from its own military and state police weapons are smuggled across its southern borders from guatemala and by boats landing on its 8 , 000 miles of coastline , weapons that often originate in venezuela , colombia , and nicaragua , or from purchases in eastern europe but it is easier for a mexican politician to blame the u s than to explain his own governments failure to police its borders , its ports of entry and its military installations did the mexican ambassador mention that over 100 , 000 soldiers have deserted the mexican army in the past seven years and that many of them took their weapons with them and joined the cartels \? lax vehicle inspection certainly , no one will deny that thousands of guns have been smuggled from the u s into mexico , but not the rocket propelled grenades and 50 caliber machine guns that the cartels have in abundance you ca n't buy that stuff at gun shops in texas or arizona but for the sake of argument , what if it was true that 30 of the weapons used by the cartels originated in the u s \? could it be that mexico has invited this traffic by its policy of not inspecting the vehicles entering mexico from the u s \? mexico only changed that policy two weeks ago and announced that it will beef up its border inspections and could it be that mexico 's decades long opposition to a u s border fence and increased border patrol vigilance has something to do with the success of the cartels' gun smuggling operations \? why strange obama response \? but what accounts for the obama administration 's eagerness to let mexico blame the u s for its spiraling violence \? two explanations are possible it may be that blaming american gun laws is for many americans an easy answer to what seems like an insoluble problem if we can end mexicos chaos by making changes on this side of the border , that 's far easier than expecting mexico to make difficult and painful changes of its own like hiring honest cops and paying them a decent wage the other explanation is more troublesome maybe the obama administration has no clue how to help mexico but sees an opportunity to help itself it is obvious that obamas teams at the justice department and the state department are exploiting the violence in mexico to justify more restrictions on gun ownership by americans the obama crews hostility to the second amendment has been clear for months this may be yet another example of rahm emanuel 's maxim never let a good crisis go to waste mexico needs to face its own demons , beginning with the corruption within its law enforcement agencies and at its ports of entry the u s can help in many ways , such as enhancing our own border security but adding more restrictions on the ownership of guns by law abiding americans will not help mexico if we are lucky , this theme of blaming american gun owners and gun shops is only a temporary distraction if it is more than that , if the obama administration really believes this is the answer to mexico 's problems , then we are lost in a swamp","as president caldern and i discussed , i am urging the senate in the united states to ratify an inter american treaty known as cifta to curb small arms trafficking that is a source of so many of the weapons used in this drug war , president obama proclaimed in mexico city last month he also incorrectly repeated the errant statistic that 90 percent of guns in the hands of mexican drug cartels come from america \( in actuality , according to atf special agent william newell , about 17 percent of guns associated with crime in mexico came from the united states and this figure has not been broken down to see how many came from civilian gun shops and how many were purchased from the u s military by mexico 's government \) we 're going to be very focused on this it 's going to be a top priority abc news quoted an administration official who said that obama felt that it was important to push now for the ratification of this treaty because the question of illegal small arms is of great concern to the countries throughout the hemisphere a s it affects their safety you have the atfe assistant director william hoover spouting the 90 figure , then everyone up and on down jumping on board with it then atf special agent william newell corrects the figure and goes on to state they do n't know how many came from the private sector and how many came from the us gov giving them to mexico yet we are supposed to punish the law abiding because other countries either ca n't or wo n't get control of their criminals",gun control,1

on pp 832 of the national geographic article of 1988 , there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one they state like carbon copies , the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140 million year old fossil virtually match they go on to report few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth the cut away drawing of a present day specimen seems almost identical with the 140 million year old fossil found in a quarry in southern west germany it is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled professor j l b smith in grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in south africa in 1938 from a rough sketch , although he had never seen a live specimen \( 30 \) throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears , differing very little in structure , showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it 's existence it would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years i think there 's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us this is true of virtually all fossils found , whether sharks or sand dollars , they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians \( the class of fish including the coelacanth \) , because they had bony elements in their fins , may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea , which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land this scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the national geographic article our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom , we never saw any of them walk , and it appears the fish is unable to do so \( 31 \) it should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish , amphibians and reptiles do , but gives live birth thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish , this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate the red tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the united states also gives live birth after nine months , two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live , wriggling , little , sharks , some lizards give live birth , so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish , amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble the fossil record here 's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the coelacanth before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed , they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish 's evolutionary journey they not only claimed that it crawled on the sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish , but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer here is hans fricke 's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which nat geo 's story is based upon and notice the last paragraph in the story the fish that time forgot sidebar msn encarta it say's this i confess i'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins professor smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth old fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers alas , that does not seem to be the case for every myth we dispelled , however , i'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made in short , we have just begun to know the coelacanth so even though this man is in no way an anti evolutionist , even he had to admit that what had been not only assumed to be true about the coelacanth , but had been widely reported as a discovery which was supported by documented fossil evidence , was a complete myth which i believe and assert can be said for all of the so called evidence which exists for the pseudo science of evolution",evolution,1

we allow and even encourage them to engage in promiscuous sex then when their sin conceives , we pretty much tell them , dont kill your babies , let our abortion facilities do it for you we march to cure breast cancer , yet promote one of the biggest contributors i am a mother of six living children , and i am a grandmother i am also a post abortive mother in the early 1970s , i suffered one involuntary and one voluntary abortion my involuntary abortion was performed just prior to roe v wade by my private physician without my consent i had gone to the doctor to ask why my cycle had not resumed after the birth of my son i did not ask for and did not want an abortion the doctor said , you dont need to be pregnant , lets see he proceeded to perform a painful examination which resulted in a gush of blood and tissue emanating from my womb he explained that he had performed a local d and c soon after the roe v wade decision , i became pregnant again there was adverse pressure and threat of violence from the babys father the ease and convenience provided through roe v wade made it too easy for me to make the fateful and fatal decision to abort our child i went to a doctor and was advised that the procedure would hurt no more than having a tooth removed the next day , i was admitted to the hospital , and our baby was aborted my medical insurance paid for the procedure as soon as i woke up , i knew that something was very wrong i felt very ill , and very empty i tried to talk to the doctor and nurses about it they assured me that it will all go away in a few days you will be fine they lied over the next few years , i experienced medical problems i had trouble bonding with my son , and his five siblings who were born after the abortions i began to suffer from eating disorders , depression , nightmares , sexual dysfunctions and a host of other issues related to the abortion that i chose to have i felt angry about both abortions , and very guilty about the abortion i chose to have the guilt made me very ill my children have all suffered from knowing that they have a brother or sister that their mother chose to abort often they ask if i ever thought about aborting them and have said , you killed our baby this is very painful for all of us also , my mother and grandparents were very sad to know about the loss of the baby the aborted childs father also regrets the abortion if it had not been for roe v wade , i would never have had that abortion , only jesus can my birthday is january 22 , and each year , this day is marred by the fact that it is the anniversary of roe v wade , and the anniversary of death for millions of babies i and my deceased children are victims of abortion , and subsequently the roe v wade decision has adversely affected the lives of my entire family i pray often for deliverance from the pain caused by my decision to abort my baby i suffered the threat of cervical and breast cancer , and experienced the pain of empty arms after the baby was gone and truly , for me , and countless abortive mothers , nothing on earth can fully restore what has been lost , only jesus can my grandfather , dr martin luther king , sr , once said , no one is going to kill a child of mine tragically , two of his grandchildren had already been aborted when he saved the life of his next great grandson with this statement his son , king once said , the negro cannot win as long as he is willing to sacrifice the lives of his children for comfort and safety how can the dream survive if we murder the children \? every aborted baby is like a slave in the womb of his or her mother the mother decides his or her fate i join the voices of thousands across america , who are silent no more we can no longer sit idly by and allow this horrible spirit of murder to cut down , yes cut out and cut away our unborn , and destroy the lives of our mothers i am very grateful to god for the spirit of repentance that is sweeping our land in repentance there is healing in the name of jesus , we must humble ourselves and pray , and turn from our wicked ways , then god will hear from heaven and heal our land i can only beseech the powers that be to hearken to the voice of the lord and remember that human life is sacred by taking the lives of our young , and wounding the wombs and lives of their mothers , we are flying in the face of god we cannot play god if we continue down this path of destruction , we will be met at the gates by our own doom this is the day to choose life we must live and allow our babies to live we must end the pain of post abortion trauma if the dream of dr martin luther king , jr is to live , our babies must live our mothers must choose life if we refuse to answer the cry of mercy from the unborn , and ignore the suffering of the mothers , then we are signing our own death warrants i too , like martin luther king , jr , have a dream i have a dream that the men and women , the boys and girls of america will come to our senses , and humble ourselves before god almighty and pray for mercy , and receive his healing grace i pray that this is the day , the hour of our deliverance may god have mercy on us all from http priestsforlife org africaname eamsurvive htm open letter to black leaders http priestsforlife org africaname openletter htm bio dr alveda c king founded king for america , inc to assist people in enriching their lives spiritually , personally , mentally and economically she is the daughter of the late slain civil rights activist rev a d king and his wife naomi barber king alveda is the grateful mother of eight children and she is a doting grandmother during the more than half century of her life , alveda has worked towards her purpose of glorifying god in the earth by accomplishing many goals currently , alveda is a minister of the gospel of jesus christ , serving as director of african american outreach for gospel of life , headed up by father frank pavone of priests for life she also consults with the africa humanitarian christian fellowship , founded by her mentor , pastor allen mcnair of believers' bible christian church in atlanta , georgia she is a former college professor , holding the masters of arts degree in business management from central michigan university her undergraduate studies in journalism and sociology helped her to become a published author , the most popular works being her best selling books sons of thunder the king family legacy , and i don't want your man , i want my own this inspirational collection of christian testimonies is used at conferences and workshops around the world alveda 's doctorate of laws was conferred by saint anslem college she has served as a senior fellow of the alexis de tocqueville institute she has also served on the boards and committees of numerous organizations , including the silent no more awareness campaign , coalition of african american pastors , and the judeo christian coalition for constitutional restoration she also served in the georgia state house of representatives , and is an accomplished actress and songwriter during the years of the civil rights movement , led by her uncle , dr martin luther king , jr , alveda 's family home was bombed in birmingham , alabama in the heat of the struggle daddy 's house was bombed , then in louisville , kentucky his church office was bombed i was also jailed during the open housing movement , she recalls alveda has continued her long term work as a civil rights activist , speaking out on issues that face society today i believe that school choice is a pressing civil rights issue perhaps the most compelling issue of all is the life of the unborn , alveda says faith in god , and the commitment to fulfill his will for our lives not faith in government bureaucracy is the key to positive action have faith in god ! this is the message that alveda carries to the world","you know something is wrong with this world when people start calling embryos and non sentient life forms victims and referring to martin luther king jr to justify their views it seems today that anyone that shows any decency or slight intelligence or common sense is labeled a radical leftist man , the republicans are getting desperate when you see them trying to equate embryos to men using mlk",abortion,0

1044@6,"city hall 8211 speaker christine c quinn , together with council member al vann , today announced legislation that would increase penalties for selling a toy gun by 500 percent the legislation would also enhance the department of consumer affairs 8217 enforcement ability and allow the agency to shut stores that are repeat offenders of the law department of consumer affairs \( dca \) commissioner jonathan mintz and criminal justice coordinator john feinblatt joined the speaker and council members at the announcement the officials also announced a new citywide public awareness campaign about the dangers of toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys 8220 despite the fact that new york city 8217 s toy and imitation gun law has been in existence for several years many merchants continue to sell items that resemble real guns , 8221 said council speaker quinn 8220 our communities are at risk when they cannot tell a fake toy gun from a real one and the dangers these items present are all too real children have been hurt and even killed as a result of these guns being out in our communities 8221 the city council 8217 s consumer affairs committee will hold a hearing on the legislation this afternoon the proposed bill would increase the fine for a first violation from 1 , 000 to up to 5 , 000 it would also increase the fines for subsequent violations within a two year period from 3 , 000 to up to 8 , 000 finally , it would also permit dca to seal , for up to five days , the premises of a store found guilty of three or more violations within a two year period current law imposes a fine of up to 1 , 000 but does not increase that amount for subsequent violations since 2002 , dca has removed more than 7 , 200 imitation guns from the shelves of nearly 240 stores throughout the city and levied 2 4 million in fines today , the city also announced a new subway advertising campaign , to be displayed in 2 , 100 subway cars , all 468 subway stations and more than 5 , 400 buses the campaign warns new yorkers of the dangers of realistic looking toy guns and the dangers of real guns that are painted to look like toys the campaign 8217 s advertisements demonstrate potential confusion about gun coloration and warn people that it is illegal either to make a fake gun look real or make a real gun look like a toy new yorkers are encouraged to call 311 about either problem calls to 311 that concern real guns that look fake will be forwarded to the police department 8217 s gun stop hotline callers can receive a 1 , 000 reward for information that leads to a conviction and can remain anonymous the city has received a grant from the new york state division of criminal justice services to support the ad campaign 8220 gun violence is plaguing the bedford stuyvesant and crown heights neighborhoods that i represent , as well as communities across the city and country , 8221 said council member al vann , prime sponsor of the bill 8220 when i introduced this legislation , my intentions were also to stem the glorification of guns within our communities , and push the businesses that we patronize to be responsible members of our neighborhoods i will continue working to address gun violence and its underlying issues in light of the senseless shooting that occurred in my district sunday night , it is apparent that we must work more diligently to stem the violence that is afflicting our neighborhoods 8221 8220 there is little debate that realistic looking toy guns pose a serious threat to the safety and welfare of police officers and new yorkers as a whole , 8221 stated deputy majority leader leroy comrie 8220 sadly , violence resulting from toy guns has happened too many times in this city this bill is a common sense solution to a very serious threat to our safety 8221 8220 toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys threaten the safety of our dedicated police officers and our children , especially during this holiday season , 8221 said criminal justice coordinator john feinblatt 8220 this public awareness campaign will help to educate the public about the dangers posed by these guns 8221 8220 imitation firearms that look real are not party items to be wrapped up and given as gifts during the holiday season , and they 8217 re certainly not toys , 8221 said consumer affairs commissioner jonathan mintz 8220 dca appreciates the council 8217 s strong and unequivocal message to the city 8217 s retailers who must do right by their customers and their communities by keeping these dangerous items off their shelves forever 8221 8220 with the holiday season in full swing , it is particularly important to bring attention to the fact that toy guns can cause accidents resulting in serious injury or death , 8221 said council member maria del carmen arroyo , co chair of the black , latino and asian caucus 8220 time and time again our communities are at risk and at serious danger when someone carries what is perceived to be a fake gun i want to thank the speaker and the administration for strengthening the penalties in hopes that repeat offenders cease to sell improper toy guns 8221 8220 last month an there was an unfortunate incident in my district where a young teen was shot by police because they mistook his toy gun for a fake one , 8221 said council member larry seabrook 8220 we need to hold these toy gun sellers accountable for selling such a heinous product our children 8217 s lives are at stake it is my hope that these penalties will finally deter stores from selling these toys our communities need to work together i ask when they see someone selling bad toy guns or when they see someone concealing a real gun for a fake one to call 311 8221 8220 this legislation will help prevent further violence by deterring businesses from selling toy guns that look real , 8221 said council member melissa mark viverito 8220 the increased regulations created by this bill will not only prevent toy guns from being used to commit crimes , but also will avert children from being wounded or killed by confused police officers who mistake their toy for a real gun 8221 8220 harlem mothers s a v e fully supports the action to increase penalties for store owners who are repeat offenders of the law and we agree that the city should have the authority to shut down such establishments and prevent their further endangering lives of our children and safety of community , said jackie rowe adams , co founder under new york city 8217 s public safety law , it is against the law to sell or offer to sell any toy or imitation firearm that can reasonably be perceived to be an actual firearm unless the exterior surface of the toy or imitation firearm is predominantly brightly colored the range of acceptable colors includes white , bright red , bright orange , bright yellow , bright green , bright blue , bright pink or bright purple","the desperate flailings of a city with absolutely no common sense they 're so impotent in their abilities to get tough on criminals , they feel it necessary to go after the most unrelated

is dr olsen 's letter in it 's entirety national museum of natural history smithsonian institution washington , d c 20560 1 november 1999 open letter to dr peter raven , secretary praven nas org committee for research and exploration national geographic society washington , dc 20036 dear peter , i thought that i should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the national geographic society with the publication of feathers for t rex \? by christopher p sloan in its november issue , national geographic has reached an all time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism but at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature although it is possible that mr czerkas will later name the specimen identified on page 100 as archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so because this latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full spread photograph of the specimen accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , the name archaeoraptor liaoningensis sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in national geographic \( international code of zoological nomenclature , article 13a , i \) this is the worst nightmare of many zoologists that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist clearly , national geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that the czerkases now plan to return it to china in washington , in june of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th international meeting of the society of avian paleontology and evolution , held at the smithsonian institution , were signatories to a letter to the director of the chinese academy of sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from china and encouraged the chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation there were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message thus , at least since mid 1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from liaoning offered for sale outside of china are contraband most , if not all , major natural history museums in the united states have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin the national geographic society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions prior to the publication of the article dinosaurs take wing in the july 1998 national geographic , lou mazzatenta , the photographer for sloan 's article , invited me to the national geographic society to review his photographs of chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story at that time , i tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what national geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that national geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that makes the news rather than reporting it his bald statement that we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing this melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned more importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact the statement on page 103 that hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical the hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the national geographic society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers a model of the undisputed dinosaur deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction the idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at nature and national geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion if sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken but it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , national geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode sincerely , storrs

1163@6,"vermont legalizes gay marriage chicagotribune com chicagotribune com vermont legalizes gay marriage the associated press 6 57 pm cdt , april 7 , 2009 montpelier , vt the marriage proposal came not over a candlelit dinner or on a scenic mountaintop instead the couple were surrounded by a throng of gay rights supporters outside the vermont house chamber we have n't decided who 's going to propose to who yet , former lawmaker robert dostis said as he stood next to his longtime partner , chuck kletecka but we 've been together 25 years in september , and i think september 14th would be a nice wedding day sounds good to me , kletecka replied i accept the exchange came just after the vermont house narrowly achieved the two thirds majority necessary to overcome republican gov jim douglas' veto of a gay marriage bill vermont was the first state to give gay and lesbian couples legal recognition with its civil unions law in 2000 it jumped to the lead again tuesday after courts in three other states had legalized gay marriage , vermont became the first to have its legislature do so on its own bills to allow same sex marriage are currently before lawmakers in new hampshire , maine , new york and new jersey the three other states that allow same sex marriage connecticut , massachusetts and iowa moved to do so first through the courts , not their legislatures for a popularly elected legislature to make this decision is a much more democratic process because lawmakers have to answer to the voters every other november , said eric davis , a retired middlebury college political science professor courts typically deal with arcane points of constitutional law while legislatures debate some of the same principles , the process may become much more personal in vermont , some of the most gripping debate came when gay lawmakers took to the house floor last thursday and told their own love stories getting gay marriage approved in a political , rather than purely legal , forum is a big step , said boston university law professor linda mclain , an expert on family law and policy what may give courage to other legislatures is that this legislature managed to do it , she said she added that using the civil rights language of equality the measure in vermont was dubbed the marriage equality bill could help make gay marriage more acceptable elsewhere opponents said they , too , believe activists will be emboldened in other states and could attack the 1996 defense of marriage act , which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and provides that states need not recognize the marriage of a same sex couple from another state the vermont action comes just days after the iowa supreme court ruled that not permitting gay marriage there was unconstitutional to the millions of americans who care about marriage , we say , 'get ready president obama and democrats will use vermont as an excuse to overturn the bipartisan federal defense of marriage act , ' said brian brown , executive director of the national organization for marriage , which waged a radio campaign against the measure the next step is to ask the supreme court to impose gay marriage on all 50 states to date , the same sex marriage movement 's main gains have been in new england , which some attribute to yankee liberalism and the gradual acceptance of gay relationships after vermont 's groundbreaking civil unions law took effect in 2000 douglas had announced his intent to veto the gay marriage bill two weeks ago , saying he believed marriage should be limited to a man and a woman and calling the issue a distraction from more important economic and budgetary issues in tuesday 's vote , a yes was needed from two thirds of those present to override the governor 's veto the goal was easily achieved in the senate , which voted 23 5 , but in the house the vote was much closer , 100 49 the speaker 's announcement of the results to a packed statehouse chamber set off whistles and cheers among supporters whose hopes had been temporarily dashed when the governor announced he would veto the measure if it passed the legislature among the celebrants were kletecka and dostis , who recalled efforts to expand gay rights dating to an anti discrimination law passed in 1992 it 's been almost 20 years to get to this point , dostis said i think finally , most people in vermont understand that we 're a couple like any other couple we 're as good and as bad as any other group of people craig bensen , a gay marriage opponent who had lobbied unsuccessfully for a nonbinding referendum on the question , said his side was outspent by supporters by 20 1 the other side had a highly funded , extremely well oiled machine with all the political leadership except the governor pushing to make this happen , he said the fact that it came down to this tight a vote is really astounding the measure had only 95 yes votes when it passed the house on friday but some changed their votes tuesday rep jeff young , d st albans , who voted no twice because he 's philosophically opposed to gay marriage , joined most other democrats in voting to override douglas' veto i think if i wanted to continue my career here and have any chance of being effective , i had to vote with my caucus , he said you have some pet projects , you think you can help your district back home with things that need to happen i want to get a railroading bill through i would n't even have had a chance to testify , let alone get it through now , people will listen

1215@1,"reading the opinions in mcdonald v chicago , you might think it was as much a civil rights case as a gun case in the ruling , the supreme court decided 54 that the second amendment applies to states and localities , not just the federal government , and struck down chicagos handgun ban the four conservative justices , along with justice anthony kennedy , formed the majority one of the conservatives , clarence thomas , also filed a concurring opinion the main disagreement betwee the two opinions concerned whether the fourteenth amendments privileges or immunities clause or its due process clause is the best way for the court to apply constitutional protections to state and local governments but in the process of making their arguments , both opinions emphasize the racial history of the fourteenth amendment the story of the postcivil war south and the federal governments crusade to ensure fair treatment for blacks therein the heart of the problem was that , in an effort to stave off rebellion and maintain the racial caste structure that had developed under slavery , state and local governments refused to respect freedmens constitutional rights crucial to the souths efforts were gun control laws that applied to blacks and blacks alone this does not show that modern gun controllers are racist , or even that the modern gun control movement has racist roots , as some have suggested the concerns that motivate sarah brady are neither the same as nor descended from the concerns that motivated racist southern governments but this does show that when a government has the ability to forbid gun ownership , it has the ability to render groups it dislikes helpless to defend themselves regardless of whether modern gun control accomplishes its purpose of reducing crime and for the record , there is no evidence it does a free society should fear a government with such power the souths campaign against black gun ownership , not surprisingly , began long before the civil war two slave rebellions in the 1820s stoked whites fears , and in response , many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting slaves from carrying firearms to apply the prohibition to free blacks as well , thomas notes georgia forbade blacks to own , use , or carry fire arms of any description whatever florida empowered patrol s of white citizens to search negro houses or other suspected places , for fire arms blacks caught with guns whether slave or free were brought to the nearest justice of the peace for whipping on the bare back , not exceeding thirty nine lashes \( they could escape punishment by providing a plain and satisfactory explanation \) it wasnt just blacks , but also anti slavery whites , whom governments tried to disarm for example , during the bleeding kansas period a series of violent skirmishes in the 1850s between pro and anti slavery elements in that future border state there were attempts to take guns from the free soilers as the majority opinion in mcdonald notes , the 1856 republican party platform described this as a violation of the right to keep and bear arms when the war ended , fear of rebellion peaked , and southern governments ramped up their efforts some states passed laws banning black gun ownership or gun carrying , and there was a systematic effort to disarm the freedmen who had served in the union army and then returned to their homes in the south roving bands of exconfederate soldiers , many affiliated with the ku klux klan , took arms from blacks by force while official law enforcement looked the other way in south carolina , a group of black citizens wrote the following to congress we ask that , inasmuch as the constitution of the united states explicitly declares that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed that the late efforts of the legislature of this state to pass an act to deprive us of arms be forbidden , as a plain violation of the constitution the problem wasnt just that the laws were discriminatory , forbidding blacks but not whites to own guns it was that the government had the right to ban gun ownership by the law abiding at all even if the south had banned all gun ownership , disarmed blacks would have had to deal with the armed and racist state militia and state peace officers , the justices note they might have added that , without technically discriminating by race , the south could have used the techniques it later employed to keep blacks from voting grandfather clauses , literacy tests , etc to exempt whites from facially non discriminatory gun bans \( we see a modern analogue to these policies in laws that prevent the poor from owning guns it costs 340 , nonrefundable , just to apply for a gun permit in new york city , and the rich and famous seem to have a lower likelihood of being rejected also , the gun control movement periodically goes after saturday night specials that is , handguns cheap enough that the poor can afford them \) it was gun control laws along with other laws that violated virtually every right blacks had that led to the fourteenth amendment , which authorized the federal government to ensure that state and local governments respected citizens rights the freedmens bureau act of 1866 , passed just two years before the amendment was approved , made it clear that the right to keep and bear arms was an important right for freed blacks to have the right to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty , personal security , and the acquisition , enjoyment , and disposition of estate , real and personal , including the constitutional right to bear arms , shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens without respect to race or color , or previous condition of slavery advocates of the civil rights act of 1866 cited the disarmament of freed blacks as a reason the law was necessary these laws , however , didnt work southern governments refused to enforce them , and the supreme court which was far less powerful then than it is today , anyhow did not intervene to drive the point home that the south had to respect blacks rights , including the right to bear arms , republicans in congress passed the fourteenth amendment \( they had the numbers to do this because they had refused to seat the democrats the south had elected , many of whom were former confederate soldiers \) , sent it to the states for ratification , put the former confederate states under martial law via the reconstruction acts , and made their ratifying the amendment a condition of ending military rule the supreme courts decision gives americans a lot to think about from the privileges or immunities clause to the courts proper role in enforcing the constitution but whenever we discuss gun control , we need to remember that a government capable of gun control is capable of tyranny both the majority opinion and thomass concurrence in mcdonald following in the steps of works such as stephen p halbrooks securing civil rights perform the crucial service of explaining how important that fact was in the wake of the civil war","so you see , brady , you 're wrong again the mcdonald ruling was n't an issue of guaranteeing white men their ability to feel safe in the face of growing minority groups quite the opposite the mcdonald ruling was about striking against those with racist and evil intentions who would use the law to render innocent people helpless for no good reason it was as much about protecting minorities from harm as anything",gun control,1

although at first blush , gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal , on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all the unfortunate answer is that , no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears , registering honest gun owners does n't stop criminals , and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction it is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal , if that goal is the reduction of crime 1 registering 70 million american households is extremely expensive do you know what it takes to run a database that big \? you need 19 , 000 changes daily , just to keep up with people who move every ten years floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs , payroll , parking and dry cleaning bills it 's a government jobs program all by itself , all in the common sense but deceptive name of stopping crime how many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done \? that 's right , none , and the planners know that all that money and time , invested on tracking the innocent that 's why so many police departments are against it they 'll be forced to run huge data centers with their limited resources , and hire clerks instead of cops 2 americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime under registration , activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon think about that possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest , if the property is n't on the government 's master list boy , that does n't sound like the american way no other evil is needed , there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place paperwork equals prison that 's just wrong 3 registration , if enacted , will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade how many times must an elite forbid what the public wants , before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties \? people get what they want either way , it 's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it with respect to guns , the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy , for gun runners 4 people have said to me , but alan , if all guns were registered and there was a crime , then you could tell tell what \? if your neighbor is shot , that 's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten block radius the evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan you need motive , opportunity , witnesses , physical evidence , the murder weapon police are n't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component 5 you do n't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people , do you \? despite real life examples recently of exactly that in new york , california and louisiana , and global history for the past century , this could n't really happen , do you think \? who would even support such a thing in a country like america , with its bill of rights \? the guarantees against confiscating property , unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power are there really u s politician who would support firearm seizures \? \( unfortunately , it 's a long list of usual suspects \) and what about the so called first amendment test \? if it 's ok for arms it must pass muster for words too why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers \? why indeed pile logic on logic , some people just feel the government should register everything , just to keep control when government has that much control , you no longer possess your liberties you 're living where government lists define who can do what , and where people control trumps crime control the gun registration model precisely this form of gun control is n't about guns , it 's about control i might favor registration if the system would include criminals in fact , i 'd favor testing the system on them first but the u s supreme court , in a widely known case \( haynes v u s , 1968 \) , had determined that a felon who has a gun cannot be compelled to complete such forms , because it violates the fifth amendment right against self incrimination that 's right , mandatory registration not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal is a self indictment of a crime , and is therefore prohibited gun listing is a feel good deception that passes unquestioned by the news media , engorges the federal or state bureaucracy , and undercuts the linchpins of american freedoms it has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words , and should be rejected outright elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very constitution they take an oath to preserve , protect and defend , and deserve to be removed from office sincerely , alan korwin , author gun laws of america note this case only concerned a limited class of weapons , destructive devices , which are listed and tracked in a special federal registry under the national firearms act congress rewrote that law after haynes to require only the legal transferor , and not the transferee , of such devices to file papers , and along with other clever changes this overcame the 5th amendment problem in u s v freed , 1971 , the court agreed the problem had been fixed \( for possession of hand grenades by criminals in that particular case \) a general registration scheme would run into a greater problem a prohibited possessor cannot have a firearm at all , so mere possession is a serious crime an additional charge for failing to register the gun that ca n't be possessed would offend the 5th amendment the same as in the haynes case however , possession of an unregistered gun by an ordinary citizen would turn that citizen into a felon , with no other illegal act but the paperwork failure the innocent would have to register to remain legal , the illegal possessor could not register without violating the right to not incriminate yourself",gun control,1

1352@6,"if one agrees to a discussion without using the bible as some people insist , then they have set the terms of the debate in essence these terms are 1 facts are neutral however , there are no such things as brute facts all facts are interpreted once the bible is eliminated in the argument , then the christians presuppositions are gone , leaving them unable to effectively give an alternate interpretation of the facts their opponents then have the upper hand as they still have their presuppositions see naturalism , logic and reality","this is where intuitive , ready agreement with the opening paragraph starts to get the reader into trouble all facts are interpreted according to presuppositions , so it 's only fair that creationists should get to bring their presuppositions to the table just like everyone else , right \? well , let 's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour , and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly should he be allowed to sit in judgement \? of course not but according to the reasoning presented by aig that leaves us in an impossible position by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race , we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy we readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence ah , but ! is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition , another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted \? one might protest that it is not , that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically but it would be in vain , because there are , after all , no such thing as 'brute facts' the data you supply to justify your position only do so when interpreted according to your presupposition that guilt can be race agnostic to someone whose presupposition is otherwise , your 'facts' mean something quite different they might for instance mean the research itself must be corrupt and biased , or at least faulty in some unknown way in short , following ken ham 's reasoning we find ourselves deep in a rabbit hole with no end in sight we can venture to justify no opinion or belief , because the facts that appear to support one may upon the least whim be reinterpreted in the light of another i may if i so choose presuppose the bible to be the work of the devil himself , and i am not to be chastised nor deterred through argument , for the axioms by which i choose to interpret the world are , in ken 's eyes , inviolate this is hardly the result ken could have intended what 's gone wrong \? why has his fair minded attempt to level the playing field backfired so badly \? the answer , of course , is that the playing field is n't really level every once in a while someone will decide that he can fly , and attempt to demonstrate this facility to the world by leaping from a high place the world thus far has remained largely unimpressed this is an extreme example of what can happen when the axioms one uses to interpret the world conflict with those upon which it really operates , and it provides the first key to unlocking our dilemma good axioms yield accurate predictions as ken rightly observed , known facts are always subject to interpretation but the reverse process , the prediction of facts yet to come based on a formulated theory , is not in making a prediction we are forced to stop shoehorning data into our preconceived worldview and make a statement about what we will find this yields the closest thing we have to a truly objective measurement of congruence between theory and reality this understanding allows us to validate or repudiate the presuppositions we bring to bear on the facts at our disposal the racist juror would from the outset predict the evidence to be presented would turn out to be stacked against the defendant , but his low 'hit rate' would invalidate his axiom so , part of what distinguishes creationism from mainstream scientific understanding is that , in hindsight and on an ongoing basis its predictions fall wide of the mark the discovery of shared pseudogenes should have been all but impossible , as should identically located retroviral insertions we should not have found fossils at all , let alone a nested hierarchy of forms we should not have been able to observe evolution and speciation we should not have been able to see very distant stars and galaxies all of these unexpected face plants for creationism have of course been rationalised away after the fact shared pseudogenes must all have some function we do n't know about there must be some determinism in the location of ervs fossils and the geological column were all laid down in the great flood the speed of light and the rate of decay of radioactive materials were different in the past but these rationalisations entail further predictions we ought not to be able to safely remove pseudogenes if they are functional but we can if erv insertion is deterministic we should see that in the lab but we do n't if fossils were laid down by the flood we would n't expect similar animals to be sorted by depth according to the number of cusps on a back tooth , or to be buried in amongst consistent strata of pollen grains , and we would n't expect there to be anything like as much limestone if decay rates had been high enough in the past to explain what we see today in just 10 , 000 years , we ought to now be breathing incandescent rock vapour instead of air and so on science also changes to accommodate the unexpected but as often as not the 'unexpected' has been discovered by scientists extrapolating existing theories to their logical conclusions , predicting something we did n't initially suspect but which has later been confirmed and that 's the bottom line creationism and science both evolve as new facts emerge , but while the result for science has been a trend towards better and more accurate predictions , indicative of closing the gap between theory and reality , creationism remains a tumbling snowball of post hoc rationalisation growing around a hard core of sacred axioms that it would certainly appear thus far make it impossible for the convergence of prediction and reality to occur",evolution,1

in the absence of dates between the two radiometric tie points , one must consider two possibilities either the sediments accumulated continuously , albeit slowly \( some two orders of magnitude more slowly than in similar environments of the same age \) , or there are breaks in time \( hiatuses or unconformities \) hidden within the poorly exposed layers on the basis of limited physical data , condon et al suggest the presence of two such unconformities in their study area near the yangtze gorges the duration of these stratigraphic breaks with respect to the environmental anomaly reflecting a dramatic change in the cycling of carbon on earth 's surface and subsequent biological innovations form the cornerstone of their conclusions , and deserve closer examination spectacular fossil animal embryos \( 13 , 14 \) of great evolutionary importance are found at weng'an \( some 375 km to the southwest of the authors' study area \) , where the doushantuo formation accumulated closer to the shoreline and records only a single surface of unconformity in such nearshore environments , oceanic sediments are often exposed above sea level , resulting in the removal of underlying sediments and hence the erasure of some fraction of geological time which of the two hiatal surfaces from the deeper water sections at the yangtze gorges correlates to the single unconformity at weng'an \? the data are more equivocal than presented by condon et al , and the choice carries important evolutionary consequences at the yangtze gorges , the extraordinary carbon cycle anomaly recorded in marine carbonates near the top of the doushanto formation is truncated by the uppermost unconformity condon et al suggest that there is little time missing across the surface , thereby preserving a causal relation between the environmental perturbation and the rapid diversification of ediacara organisms and associated faunas around 550 million years ago however , correlation of this surface and the intervening sediments back to weng'an tells another story at weng'an , both the carbon cycle anomaly and the sediments typical of the uppermost doushantuo formation at the yangtze gorges are missing , implying a substantial hiatus comparison of broadly equivalent strata in southern australia and the western united states suggests a stratigraphic architecture similar to that in southern china , where similar carbon cycle anomalies are truncated by unconformities \( 15 \) in the western united states , the post anomaly unconformity removes a minimum of 130 m of section , more than the entire thickness of the doushantuo formation these observations suggest that the unconformity separating the ediacaran faunas and the carbon cycle anomaly in southern china may , in fact , hide a lot of time , thereby decoupling the environmental and biological events that the authors wish to connect this is not meant to detract from the important radiometric calibration that condon et al provide , but rather to note that the stratigraphic relations between these dates , and therefore their connection to evolutionary events , are far from straightforward according to condon et al , the rapid diversification of complex multicellular organisms in ediacaran oceans forced the carbon cycle anomaly seen worldwide , but this seems possible only if there is no real time missing across the upper doushantuo unconformity if this is not the case , then this interpretation may be placing the cart before the horse alternative models suggest that environmental changes may have driven evolutionary transformations in particular , atmospheric oxygen long believed to be an external forcing factor to evolution appears to have built up rapidly during the ediacaran period , not because of a discrete biological event but as a result of the tectonic forces that lift and erode mountain ranges \( 16 \) through precise radiometric clocks and clever stratigraphic connections , geoscientists can increasingly correlate ediacaran sediments that are separated widely in space and time these tools allow us to piece together a complex puzzle of unforgettable biological events against a background of repetitive climatic and environmental perturbations however , even with exact dates , the cyclicity of these events and the specter of a fragmentary rock record add uncertainty to our picture of ediacaran earth history references 1 a h knoll et al , science 305 , 621 \( 2004 \) 2 j p grotzinger et al , science 270 , 598 \( 1995 \) 3 m w martin et al , science 288 , 841 \( 2000 \) 4 j e amthor et al , geology 31 , 431 \( 2003 \) abstract 5 k h hoffmann et al , geology 32 , 817 \( 2004 \) abstract 6 c r zhou et al , geology 32 , 437 \( 2004 \) abstract 7 d condon et al , science 308 , 95 \( 2005 \) published online 24 february 2005 \( 10 1126 science 1107765 \) 8 s j burns , a matter , eclogae geol helv 86 , 595 \( 1993 \) 9 c r calver , precambrian res 100 , 121 \( 2000 \) abstract 10 f a corsetti , a j kaufman , geol soc am bull 115 , 916 \( 2003 \) abstract 11 p f hoffman et al , science 281 , 1342 \( 1998 \) 12 p f hoffman , d p schrag , terra nova 14 , 129 \( 2002 \) abstract 13 s h xiao et al , nature 391 , 553 \( 1998 \) abstract 14 j y chen et al , science 305 , 218 \( 2004 \) 15 n christie blick et al , am j sci 290a , 295 \( 1990 \) 16 a j kaufman , f a corsetti , eos trans agu 85 , fall meet suppl abstr pp41a 0575 \( 2004 \)","so , any creationist want to tell us why these people are so wrong \?
