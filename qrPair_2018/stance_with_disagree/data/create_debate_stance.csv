abortion,"i 'll be more blunt it is n't your responsibility to teach others moral lessons that involve contracting fatal diseases , or ruining their lives such behaviour is vindictive and arrogant that is your subjective opinion , i on the other hand disagree i think my 'lesson' is entirely valid personal responsibility is very important it is n't arbitrary it aligns with law what law , of which nation \? besides laws can be changed being against killing is n't much of an argument we kill every day as far as i and anyone who has ever looked at a foetus is concerned , killing a foetus is little different from killing an apple when you made cider utterly ridiculous an apple is a fruit and is not a multi cellular organism , such as a human foetus i do not kill human foetuses everyday and that is what we are discussing not apples or plums or oranges lol","plant cells of a fruit are alive but they are not part of an independent unique multicellular organism so asexually reproducing life is n't sacred now \? in order to be sacred you need different dna \? i never understood that argument , quite frankly and i have heard it before as if having unique dna gives you consciousness and individuality fruit cells envelop seeds \( usually \) and they are alive the only important difference between them and foetal cells is that foetal cells lack a cell wall both a foetus and a fruit if left alone have the potential to grow a new life in the case of a fruit , the seeds may grow into new trees or shrubs in the case of a foetus , it may grow into a human both have this potential , but they are not presently realised this is what you are saying effectively that my testes are individual animals i never said that apples were independent life forms , but when you pick them from the tree they do live on their own apart from it also , if you want to get into the biology of it , the cells which make up your testes are part of an evolved collective of cells , a relationship which evolved over many millions of years multicellular life is , in a sense , many cells working together through evolved inter dependence so in a historical sense , yes , your testes have cells which are animals \( animals need not be multicellular \) but which are evolved to be genetically identical and inter dependent",-1,+1,0

is it because you are denying the fact \? i do n't care because it does n't matter i have no right to decide what is good and what is not for other people perhaps some people end up more responsible , perhaps some do n't the whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince to justify and prove , eh \? a debate is a means , the purpose is invented by the individual this is still a debate whether my method is through debunking your conclusion or putting forth my own well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences if you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone you seem to be under the delusion that one can derive a position from facts without forming an opinion a position without opinion is just facts , a position without facts is just opinion you need both i'm not arguing against the facts , i'm arguing against your stupidity do n't try to shift the blame onto the facts , they ca n't help what they are why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case because your argument is rooting in morality , mine is rooting in questioning your morality if you disagree with the origins of abortion for the same reason then it makes no difference , you 're still arguing from your personal preferences and the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself then start a debate how did abortion originate \? it 's another topic and does n't bare any relevance to this one look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you \? you would n't like my answer p who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter \? me or you \? you are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth can you please get through just one sentence with proper grammar \? you can pull up facts until your fingers are worn to stubs it means nothing if they are n't relevant if you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name \? you totally missed the point is that all you can say you came up with it \? because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion are you dyslexic \? that made almost no sense again , look up the term debunking but i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them \? again , i 've said no such thing at least try to make relevant arguments i do n't want them to be grateful to me , i want that child to be grateful to me a life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society well well , what a noble man you are placing the value of life above the value of a good life did i say noble \? i meant retarded well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think if i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams \? would i and end up coming out on the winning end \? again , either you are a liar or your league is full of idiots \) because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument you think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating debating 101 debunking and calling out opponents on non sequiters is how a debate works there 's no need to prove someone else 's abortion is none of my \( or your \) business debunking your reasons for being pro life does that by itself do you understand \? you said a district attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why do n't you try becoming one first and them judge them , and that is if you can ever become one 1 2 3 lt lt you understand this , right \? well , here 's a line of reasoning almost as simple and easy to comprehend district attorneys are people people can be stupid and childish therefore , district attorneys can be stupid and childish there 's no need to become a district attorney to understand that they are n't infallible really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change \? if that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms everything is constantly changing you 're heart pumps fresh blood , your skin falls off and is replaced , sperms turn into zygotes etc etc etc life and death are n't opposites , they 're complementariness well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from wrong again i'm not building an argument , i'm debunking yours there 's no running here , simply wading through the things you 've said and lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning come on use your head and not only your eyes do i have to explain everything to you \? nothing you just wrote changes that your hitler debate has nothing to do with this debate you could be lying about the whole thing for all i know come on use your head and not only your eyes do i have to explain everything to you \?

i think your problem is you love to judge and if you continue doing that then again i will restrain you from debate and then we will see who is the debater and the respondent let us keep it to a professional level please by doing this you are making both of us look like two children which we are not my conclusion is drawn from facts which i have demonstrated in my arguments but you point to one part where you made reference to facts \? did you see my entire argument was based on fallacy \? because if you said so then i think you are jumping to an inconsistent conclusion and again i do not care what you call me because like i said i have already proved myself to a panel of judges you can say all you want but it would n't affect me but lets just keep it as a debate on a professional level",+1,-1,0

articlekey 4769 so who cares what is legal and what is not legal laws change all the time was n't slavery considered legal \? is n't it illegal now \? aobrtion is the intentional taking of a human life and murder is also the intentional taking of a human life it 's the human life part you seem to be having a problem with yes , the fetus is alive , and it has human dna , but i think it is foolish to place its life on the same level as , say , an actual baby to do so is to say abortion is identical to the murder of a 6 month old baby let me put it this way to you , i am standing holding a gun to a man 's head , and i have two choices , one is to kill him and the other is not to kill him if i kill him i will be doing something that is both morally and legally wrong if i save him , i will be doing something that is both morally and legally right if another organism \( human or not \) is using a human being as a life support system , the human that is functioning as a life support system has a right to order the end of such a relationship in your example , the man you are about to shoot is perfectly capable of living without using your body if you wish to end your involvement with him , you can walk away a woman who wants to get an abortion does not have this luxury , so the situations are incomparable in that respect i posed a hypothetical situation in a previous post that i believe you also ignored someone has a child when their child is 10 years old , he becomes gravely ill only an organ transplant will save him unfortunately , the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents for whatever reason , the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs should the government get involved and force one of the parents to give the child an organ , under threat of charging them with murder if they do not \? if yes , why draw the line at a parent child situation \? why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list \? if no , why not \? after all , the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate , and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life a living human at the expense of their own bodies you still used the term fetus so the laws still apply to fetus and homicide which means that the fetus is still considered as human life the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in america because a fetus is not legally considered a human life do you live in country where they do , or do you live in fantasy america \? i also fail to see how my use of the term 'fetus' means that the law suddenly applies to it but one of the laws of science in defining the term of life states that inorder for an individual to be referred to as having life , they have to be able to be distinguished from the dead again , not my opinion but the findings of scientists you do realize that i am not arguing that the fetus is dead , right \? so is that why you want to kill a fetus \? because you know it will develop into a human being because according to you an aborted fetus cannot develop into a human being why would it develop into a human being if you already took the life of it \? furthermore , when a fetus is formed , organ formation begins about three weeks after the fetus itself is formed including a beating heart which pumps blood it is nonsensical to imply that anyone wants to kill a fetus because it will develop into a human being people get abortions because they do not want to be pregnant , and pregnancy should be a voluntary process if there was a way in which the pregnancy could be terminated and the fetus preserved , that would be ideal as it is , no such thing exists , the interests of a fully developed and conscious human being should override the interests of a fetus that has no more consciousness than a human lung nb when i mentioned the term you i am referring to pro choice supporters and not you specifically furthermore let me also be clear that i support spontaneous abortion and not induced abortion since spontaneou abortion since spontaneous abortion is beyond the control of the woman even the accidental loss of human life merits an investigation , and it is quite possible to purposefully induce a miscarriage through many avenues if a fetus is placed on the same level as a human being , then women who miscarried should be immediately subjected to an investigation and arrested for murder if it was determined she is at least partially responsible for the miscarriage , either through intention or negligence",-1,+1,0

abortion,"looking at the world in black and white with complete disregard for reality is intelectually lazy , and i'm not at all shy to say it the world is complicated , and when you look at it through an uncompromising moralistic lense you end up oversimplifying problems and giving simplistic answers calling abortion murder is simplistic and misses the point of the debate i am doing my best to discuss the issue as rationally as possible but when you make statements like well if i'm intellectually lazy because i can look at a murder and without thinking say it is wrong , than i'm guilty as charged it makes it really difficult to continue of course no one wants to get an abortion whether you believe it to be murder or not , it 's still a sad event and you 'd have to be heartless not to feel something what i am arguing is that banning abortion is not the best way to reduce the suffering that unwanted pregancies causes instead we should concentrate on improving sex education , and helping increase the standard of living of the poor \( a group that is disproportionately more likely to have unwanted pregancies and get abortions \) i know this is difficult for you to understand on your moral high horse , but stop and consider that there might be more to the issue then the oversimplified version that has been hammered into your thick little skull since birth i'm sorry but a single cell 's rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do not trump the right a woman to choose whether or not she wants to be a mother we are talking about something that does n't exist as a thinking feeling human being , and i do n't understand why you ca n't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs the most dangerous place in america should n't be a mother 's womb i agree , and that 's why i said that a viable fetus should be considered a full human being , however you choose again and again to ignore this fact","looking at the world in black and white is called moral clarity somethings are obviously wrong like theft , rape and murder to say otherwise would be foolish and be to deny the obvious now you may use your intellect to justify those acts but then your intellect becomes complicit in the act not a place i want to go of course no one wants to get an abortion if that were true no one would get an abortion people get abortions because they want to in regards to feel something and the suffering that unwanted pregnancies causes you seem to miss the greater suffering and depression women feel after an abortion , a suffering that last a life time that suffering is far greater than that of finding out you got pregnant that 's the suffering i want to end not to mention the trauma of the child which just lead nebraska to ban abortions after 20 weeks it 's called the pain capable unborn child protection act i do n't understand why you ca n't rap your head around the idea of increasing rights as development occurs because it is wrong to base the value of another human on subjective terms like those adopting subjective standards makes it possible for the strong to exploit the weak and that 's exactly what your standard does you ought to be protecting the weak and innocent , not using your intellect to come up with ways to justify their killing for example you said a viable fetus should be considered a full human being so those that are not , are not human \? you 've just stripped them of their objective humanity by your subjective definition of humanity and now you feel justified in killing them , i'm sorry but that 's not proper justification i do hope you can see how dangerous your point of view is because it puts even your life in danger if logically followed through all i have to do is be more powerful than you and determine that your life is not viable by my standards and then i'm free to kill you might makes right that 's why abortion should be banned , because all human life is valuable by the fact that it is human if we move the value from the objective to the subjective than no one is safe and we have turned the law on it 's head because laws are meant to protect people but who is a person is subject to the opinion of another i do n't know about you but i never would want to be treated like that",+1,-1,0

i called you one name in the previous comment i called you it because you deserve to be called it you said something that was hypocritical so i pointed out that you are a hypocrite , because you are indeed a hypocrite that does n't compare to you calling me a butcher , murderer , pro murder , illogical , humanist , pro abortion all of which are untrue making you a super hypocrite , therefore you think i'm loosing \?

well , that just shows how the comment 'no circumstance matters unless she 's dying' is still hypocritical hypocrite i am not arguing in this column that it happens often , i am arguing that you are not truly pro life and that the pro life stance on abortion is discompassionate showing once again that you fail to see the real point behind my argument stop living in your magical world and start reading my comments holy crap well , you 're right about that , but that does n't make your beliefs any less illogical in relation to the grand scheme of good and evil that 's what happens when you take a radical opinion you do n't think about everyone , you just think about a specific direction of people i do n't care only about myself how do i only care about myself , you hypocrite \?

abortion,"well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument \? you 're so wrapped up in this duality you 've created you have n't even considered that my position is not one of morality i'm not for or against abortion it 's called pro choice not pro abortion you never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right no , you 've imposed this position on me this is a matter of your prejudice , not my implication why do n't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not \? is it because you are denying the fact \? i do n't care because it does n't matter i have no right to decide what is good and what is not for other people perhaps some people end up more responsible , perhaps some do n't the whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince to justify and prove , eh \? a debate is a means , the purpose is invented by the individual this is still a debate whether my method is through debunking your conclusion or putting forth my own well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences if you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone you seem to be under the delusion that one can derive a position from facts without forming an opinion a position without opinion is just facts , a position without facts is just opinion you need both i'm not arguing against the facts , i'm arguing against your stupidity do n't try to shift the blame onto the facts , they ca n't help what they are why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case because your argument is rooting in morality , mine is rooting in questioning your morality if you disagree with the origins of abortion for the same reason then it makes no difference , you 're still arguing from your personal preferences and the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself then start a debate how did abortion originate \? it 's another topic and does n't bare any relevance to this one look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you \? you would n't like my answer p who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter \? me or you \? you are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth can you please get through just one sentence with proper grammar \? you can pull up facts until your fingers are worn to stubs it means nothing if they are n't relevant if you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name \? you totally missed the point is that all you can say you came up with it \? because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion are you dyslexic \?

again , either you are a liar or your league is full of idiots \) because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument you think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating debating 101 debunking and calling out opponents on non sequiters is how a debate works there 's no need to prove someone else 's abortion is none of my \( or your \) business debunking your reasons for being pro life does that by itself do you understand \? you said a district attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why do n't you try becoming one first and them judge them , and that is if you can ever become one 1 2 3 lt lt you understand this , right \? well , here 's a line of reasoning almost as simple and easy to comprehend district attorneys are people people can be stupid and childish therefore , district attorneys can be stupid and childish there 's no need to become a district attorney to understand that they are n't infallible really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change \? if that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms everything is constantly changing you 're heart pumps fresh blood , your skin falls off and is replaced , sperms turn into zygotes etc etc etc life and death are n't opposites , they 're complementariness well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from wrong again i'm not building an argument , i'm debunking yours there 's no running here , simply wading through the things you 've said and lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning come on use your head and not only your eyes do i have to explain everything to you \?

one thing we are taught in law is not to accept any fact until proper evidence is produced and you check those sources you produced and tell me what the problem is with them you never used sources like that in an argument because of the validity of the facts become a question abortion is murder but became known as a woman 's right to choose after the case roe vs wade tried why do you think abortion in society was considered murder \? point out atleast one phrase in those source which talks about the fetus being a parasite and has evidence to show that it is indeed a fetus \? you gave me a page from a pro life page , basically biased by default because they are trying to convince readers that their agenda is the correct one i gave you four scientific and unbiased sources that defined a parasite host relationship between two organisms not two species two organisms if you cannot see how the fetus fits that definition , which you clearly cannot , then you are beyond being reached by explanation so are you trying to say that a person who has lost the functioning brain has lost their identity as well \? perhaps but , regardless , their life is not dependent on the body of another , therefor there is no need for their death if someone does not want to be involved with them i am saying this to cut off another rebuttal about euthanizing comatose patients our brian does not gives us identity dna gives us human identity and the human heart gives us life within our body or maintains it if it is not a brain or a consciousness that gives us our identity , but rather the simple possession of human dna and the act of being kept alive by a heart , then again , i contend that a fetus and a human liver are equally alive and deserve comparable rights why does it have nothing to do with their potential when the six month old baby was a fetus \? dont that demonstrate the potential aspects of a fetus \? this is absolute nonsense i really have no idea what you are trying to say abortion is the killing of the fetus because it has a beating heart and according to you it is alive if something is alive and you are in the process of destroying its existence completely , isnt that the process of killing it \? i think i have said before that nobody kills a fetus because it is alive , or because it has a heart please pay attention to the implications of sentence structure people might kill a fetus because it is dependent on their body and they do not want it to reside in their body anymore , and there is no way to remove it without causing its death again , i am in criminal law and i was taught that fetuses are protected by homicide laws so it isnt about what you agree with or not , it is about what the laws are why do you think when the a accused is accused of murdering a woman and if she is pregnant , the district attorney will institute a charge of double homicides against the accused \? the homicide laws comes into effect when the life of the mother is taken or when the life of the fetus istaken without the consent of the mother let me ask you this , if a licensed doctor performs an abortion on a woman without her permission or consent and knowledge , what do you think the da will do \? the da will institute a chage of homicide \? i am not in criminal law so i almost hesitate to say this , but it seems as though you were taught false or , at best , misleading information http www chronline org feticide 20versus 20homicide pdf but according to doctors and scientists you refer to something as having life \( and i quote life not alive \) when they can be able to distinguish it from the dead what part of this statement are you having a tough time with \? it 's relevance did i ever say that you referred to the fetus as being dead \? english is my first language we are having a problem in this debating because you are basically just giving your opinion without lack of evidence i understand that you do not contest this fact so then why are you arguing about life then \? this is not what i state but what scientists and doctors states that is why i mentioned it for the third time because i believe you have a tough time understanding the true aspect of the statement i made i dont want to hear because something is alive does not mean it has life i need evidence to back that up okay i think i understand your train of thought and why you keep harping on the whole not dead alive thing if this is incorrect , point out where i went wrong anything that is distinguishable from the dead alive anything that is alive a life the act of ending a life killing killing murder murder homicide if this is a correct summary of your line of thinking , then you draw no distinctions between different forms of life , their capabilities , and the rights they are afforded , and additionally , you draw no distinction between murder and any other method of ending any form of life it would mean that shooting someone in pure self defense homicide accidentally striking a pedestrian who was not in a cross walk homicide slaughtering a chicken for food homicide plucking a flower homicide using antibacterial soap homicide if this is incorrect , then i actually do not have any idea why you keep bringing this point up , because clearly you are capable of a \) distinguishing between different forms of life b \) realizing that life with higher functions are granted more rights under the law , and c \) understanding that the law does not protect any form of life from being ended by any means every miscarriage could be investigated if the laws permitted it to investigate it the fetus is protected by human rights to certain extents people estimate that as few as 15 and as high as 78 of pregnancies end in miscarriage , many times before the woman even knew she was pregnant even on the low end of the estimate , that is a lot of women to subject to a homicide investigation directly after they experience miscarriage then , if it has been convincingly shown the abortion was not 'spontaneous' \( how \?

abortion,"you obviously feel killing is ok , i do not i have never made this claim you are putting words in my mouth you do n't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion that is because i do n't think abortion is wrong in every circumstance i think some people have the wrong motivations to abort a baby and or under the wrong medical circumstances , making some abortion cases morally wrong i give it personhood but the idea of personhood is something that you have not defined clearly if you want to argue on the basis of personhood , then a baby within the first trimester does n't even have a brain to speak of it , therefore , does n't have the ability to feel , let alone reason , within the first trimester war is about protection how can the unborn fight for its protection \? you are comparing the two wrongly war is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself even if i were to accept that the unborn baby is a person \( which is a view that i do not necessarily agree with , as i 've explained above \) , then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life threatening illness ! well obviously you do n't think life is sacredyour pro abortion lol i'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour that just goes to show how frivolous you are what a hypocrite and , by the way , i do n't think human life is sacred and i do n't believe in the sanctity of human life if you think that life is sacred , then you , by logical deduction , should not be able to eat anything that has life \( i e animals and even vegetables and fruits \) its nine short monthsto do what is rightto allow something to live you are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through during the nine short months furthermore , you said allow something to live , right \? if the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother , then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the mother to live if you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby , are you doing what is right \? after conception it is a separate human being it is not as i have explained , the baby is not a human being within the first trimester furthermore , the unborn baby , no matter at any stage , is dependent on it 's mother completely for nutrition in other words , the baby is , technically speaking , a parasite the oxford english dictionary defines a parasite as biol an animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism \( technically called its host \) and draws its nutriment directly from it also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others , but not at their expense \( strictly called commensal or symbiotic \) also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance , as the cuckoo , the skua gull , etc thus , by definition , the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body at the expense of her own health how barbaric and cold is that \? which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not or whether it should be legal or not this is simply an appeal to emotion it should not matter whether the child will make it or not then , whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you pro choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision they do not promote abortion , simply the legalisation of abortion if you ca n't see the difference , then you 're an idiot abortion is premeditated killing and so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live if the mother 's life is threatened by the pregnancy , by not aborting the child , you are also premeditating the killing of the mother thus , by your standards , you face a paradox i am appalled by how people can call themselves pro life when they say that the mother 's life does n't matter as long as the baby is not aborted this is hypocrisy of the greatest degree most pro aborts say abortion is good becausethe child might have problemsmight grow up in povertymight face lives trials i am not a pro abort i am pro choice , as i have explained the difference so do n't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life so full of misery that they would be better off dead you are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery thus , you are attacking a straw man poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been allowed to survive face you said this again , not necessarily i support abortion only when a foetus ca n't be confidently said to lack rationality , autonomy and self consciousness now wait one minute here can a newborn baby do any of these \? no of course it does it has autonomy and self consciousness but then again , even if i agree with you , by saying that a newborn baby ca n't have such experiences , it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral thus , your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand are you telling me that you want abortion legal because the woman has a right to her own body the short answer is yes , but the long answer is no congratulations , you have proven that you at least have some level of intelligence","but to declare them to be irresponsible , by your own definition of what irresponsible parents are supposed to act like , would be presumptuous how so \?

abortion,"you obviously feel killing is ok , i do not i have never made this claim you are putting words in my mouth you do n't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion that is because i do n't think abortion is wrong in every circumstance i think some people have the wrong motivations to abort a baby and or under the wrong medical circumstances , making some abortion cases morally wrong i give it personhood but the idea of personhood is something that you have not defined clearly if you want to argue on the basis of personhood , then a baby within the first trimester does n't even have a brain to speak of it , therefore , does n't have the ability to feel , let alone reason , within the first trimester war is about protection how can the unborn fight for its protection \? you are comparing the two wrongly war is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself even if i were to accept that the unborn baby is a person \( which is a view that i do not necessarily agree with , as i 've explained above \) , then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life threatening illness ! well obviously you do n't think life is sacredyour pro abortion lol i'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour that just goes to show how frivolous you are what a hypocrite and , by the way , i do n't think human life is sacred and i do n't believe in the sanctity of human life if you think that life is sacred , then you , by logical deduction , should not be able to eat anything that has life \( i e animals and even vegetables and fruits \) its nine short monthsto do what is rightto allow something to live you are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through during the nine short months furthermore , you said allow something to live , right \? if the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother , then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the mother to live if you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby , are you doing what is right \? after conception it is a separate human being it is not as i have explained , the baby is not a human being within the first trimester furthermore , the unborn baby , no matter at any stage , is dependent on it 's mother completely for nutrition in other words , the baby is , technically speaking , a parasite the oxford english dictionary defines a parasite as biol an animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism \( technically called its host \) and draws its nutriment directly from it also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others , but not at their expense \( strictly called commensal or symbiotic \) also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance , as the cuckoo , the skua gull , etc thus , by definition , the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body at the expense of her own health how barbaric and cold is that \? which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not or whether it should be legal or not this is simply an appeal to emotion it should not matter whether the child will make it or not then , whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you pro choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision they do not promote abortion , simply the legalisation of abortion if you ca n't see the difference , then you 're an idiot abortion is premeditated killing and so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live if the mother 's life is threatened by the pregnancy , by not aborting the child , you are also premeditating the killing of the mother thus , by your standards , you face a paradox i am appalled by how people can call themselves pro life when they say that the mother 's life does n't matter as long as the baby is not aborted this is hypocrisy of the greatest degree most pro aborts say abortion is good becausethe child might have problemsmight grow up in povertymight face lives trials i am not a pro abort i am pro choice , as i have explained the difference so do n't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life so full of misery that they would be better off dead you are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery thus , you are attacking a straw man poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been allowed to survive face you said this again , not necessarily i support abortion only when a foetus ca n't be confidently said to lack rationality , autonomy and self consciousness now wait one minute here can a newborn baby do any of these \? no of course it does it has autonomy and self consciousness but then again , even if i agree with you , by saying that a newborn baby ca n't have such experiences , it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral thus , your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand are you telling me that you want abortion legal because the woman has a right to her own body the short answer is yes , but the long answer is no congratulations , you have proven that you at least have some level of intelligence","doubt that you can call the use of contraception irresponsible no but contraception is not 100 effective even with protection , the parents are fully accept g \( or rationally should be \) that a pregnancy is a possible outcome of their activities so to have sex , even with protection , one should be ready to accept the potential outcomes , however unlikely second , your other premise is the the zygote is a human life human homo sapien a zygote has the dna of a homo sapien it is obviously alive you are too smart to argue that it is dead life is a scientific definition for our proposes so it is inappropriate for you to cite the oed a zygote is not a sentient human being did you think i would n't notice your clever addition \?

abortion,"i wrote this speech read it and it will answer your questions abortion choose life it begins at conception think about this a girl had an abortion , thinking that the baby wasnt living so it wouldnt matter but , after she had the abortion , she saw what she thought wasnt living , and it actually was the baby was living and she watched it die from then on , she couldnt even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being this story that i just told you is true a lot of women think that it isnt a baby before they have the abortion , and i will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby well , if life doesnt begin at birth , then when does it begin \? life begins at conception this is a fact , because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up for example , there is scientific proof and there is biblical proof to further explain what abortion is , i will talk about these important things one , it is spiritually right that life begins at conception , two , how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception , three , what we can do about the abortions , and finally , why girls get abortions those are all the things that should be thought about , so i will be explaining them , to help you understand them some woman have abortions because of these three things one , they might think that theyre too young to have a baby , two , their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion , three , if they do have the abortion the girls parents would get mad at her the case also might be that she just doesnt want to deal with the baby first , you probably ought to know what abortion is abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant every year 1 5 million babies are killed by abortion thats 125 , 000 babies killed a month , making it 4 , 000 babies killed each day , or one baby killed every 20 seconds , that is so amazingly awful that is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds how brutal the fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right as it says in the bible jeremiah 1 5 says , before i formed you in the womb , i knew you , before you were born i set you apart the bible says that life begins at conception , meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being there are many bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception , like the one i just said that bible verse , jeremiah 1 5 is saying that god intended a unique human being , starting at conception just because you cant see or feel the baby inside of you , doesnt mean its not a baby , and alive and a human being , just like you that is what a lot of people do not think about , even though you really should there also is scientific proof some people may think that life begins at birth , or some people even later , but that is wrong , life begins at conception because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception , then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being for example , the heart beat starts gradually , over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life also , dna defines a separate human being , and so when does a person form their own dna \? a person gets their own dna at conception that is a whole lot of proof , so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old , so why isnt it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mothers womb \? that is a question that probably will go unanswered forever , or they will just say that the baby is not living , which is a complete lie now , what can we do about abortion \? there many things that we can do about abortion if you start supporting this pro life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down , and the law will have to change but , most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion , and save the innocent little babies now , how can we stop abortion \? there are many ways to help stop abortion another way is you can donate money to a place like the pregnancy resource center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion you can also write to the president or another government representative , and tell them about all this proof that i have told you , hoping that their hearts will change and then the law in conclusion to all of this , it is spiritually right that life begins at conception , and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception there are many ways that you can help stop abortion , so i hope that you take a while and do that there are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion , so you really should not have one just remember that god loves the person getting the abortion and the beautiful , innocent little babies thank you and i hope that you have realized that life begins at conception , you should help the pro life movement , and that having an abortion is wrong my own mother has 6 children and has never had an abortion ! !","life does n't begin at conception a pregnancy is a process of creating a life this process begins with conception so conception is merely the beginning of a process before the fetus can actually be kept alive outside of the mother 's womb by society , then the mother alone must have the choice society should not take away her choice unless society can keep it alive without her",-1,+1,0

you said you would not deny a woman the right to kill , therefore you are pro abortion , because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed you are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing lol you pro aborts kill me no pun intended what does pain have to do with anything \?

you personally believe but you still condone yes , but no but maybe you do n't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate i stated it 's neither right nor wrong it 's based on circumstance and how the woman feels i do n't condemn anyone who has abortion you gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting you personally wouldnt abort on these grounds well my dear what grounds would you kill \? i would n't have an abortion personally just because i think other people have the right does n't mean i 'd do it myself the only reason i 'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child i bring up hitler because margaret sanger influenced him and she was the founder of planned parenthood your views on this mirror theirs because they acted them out do some research and you will see google sanger and hitler then see if you agree with them if you do n't i would like to know what you disagree with them on are you fucking kidding me \? here is one of margaret 's views advocate abortions on afro americans in order to eliminate what she called socially undesirable people so i'm a racist now \? and there is a massive difference here for a start i do n't believe anyone should be forced to have an abortion it 's their choice and another she called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers , and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf , blind and dependent she condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries , and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy sanger 's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die i do n't agree with anything this woman promoted or believed she did n't believe woman had the right to choose abortion she wanted to force them without a choice she is racist scum and i have no common ground with any of these views this is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of how dare you \? you call me a pig and then tell me i am mean for comparing your views to hitler \? come on i never denied that i called you a name hypocrite all you 've done since this debate began is name call , i will retaliate do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children do you also defend people who murder , rape , steal \? hell you make excuses for everything you are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn no i do n't , they 're not even the same thing they 're not the same circumstance i do n't make excuses i share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects how is not condemning something making excuses not everyone has to agree with you , it 's not the final word or the truth it 's an opinion you think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks , it was the wrong sex but its ok , if its deformed hold up ! i did n't say it was wrong i said it was a little selfish i never said she could n't you said you would not deny a woman the right to kill , therefore you are pro abortion , because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed you are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing you are a vile , horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this how dare you say i contribute to abortion if a woman asked me if she should have an abortion i 'd say 'it 's up to you , it 's your choice' i would n't judge her , i would n't influence her opinion if someone is considering an abortion than they are n't anti abortion anyway and pro abortionists existing wo n't mean diddly squat to their decision what does pain have to do with anything \?

i mean that would be inhumane right \? you are a joke yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion , hence i think it 's okay before then pain has everything to do with it , if death was n't painful people would n't be so scared of it i do n't have to be entirely pro abortion just like i would n't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance i would like if my daughter was starving i 'd steal food for her without a second thought again thanks for the insult , what a wonderful christian you are you can act self righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people , demeaning them and being downright rude not to mention you lie very godly you say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason \( the man is not an issue unless money is involved \) is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it 's money \?

if the burden of proof was on you , i suspect you would have trouble showing that abortion restores health to a pre pregnancy level an abortion performed without complications will not damage a woman 's health and abortion is one of the safest medical procedures it 's a faster way than pregnancy to return to a pre pregnancy health level the most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness a negative impact on mental health is rare it would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they did n't want http www guttmacher org pubs gpr 09 3 gpr090308 html http www prochoice org about abortion facts safety of abortion html http www prochoice org about abortion facts post abortion issues html","the most common emotions reported after abortion are relief and happiness a negative impact on mental health is rare it would be rarer still if abortion was not stigmatized and if no women were ever pressured into an abortion they did n't want i want to take issue with what you said here how do you know what women feel after abortions \? you have no clue whatsoever and neither do the professionals i talk here from experience , one who knows who has gone through this most women suffer silently if they have had abortions this is not acceptable table talk at the dinner table or any table for that matter not many woman i know want to talk about what they didwho wants friends and family to know they killed a family member \? no women do not report itthey do n't talk about it they try to forget it this is not so easy last sunday was right to life sunday and our pastor gave a sermon on this i can only imagine how many women were sitting there who had had an abortion and were suffering its why most pastors wo n't even touch the issue lets not make women feel bad lets hide it i work with a group silent no more we minister to women and families and friends who are suffering from abortions abortion affects not just the woman but her familythat is if she tells them she had an abortion i have worked in this field for over ten yearsand the stories and tears i have seenis unbelievable do not say women do not suffer that is propaganda that pro aborts , that planned parenthood wants people to think if you asked the majority of women however if they think about itregret it you would be shockedthat is if they had the guts to admit again they had one its funny is n't it thatthe most performed surgical procedure in americaand we do n't talk about it how many women tell family and friendshey ca n't meet for lunch going to get an abortion does not happen for all the obvious reasons",+1,-1,0

living beings that do n't meet your imaginary criteria , merit protection due to moral concerns for instance if i were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only

it does me that 's why i oppose all these things final thoughts football does have morality as do all sports , it 's called the rules of the game there 's a way you play that makes it football and a way that makes it no longer football pragmatism is is a poor method for law since it has no way of telling what the good is also do a word study on the etymology of the word ethic and tell me what you come up with because i may be mistaken but i thought ethics \( ethos \) were fixed standards and morality \( mores \) were changing standards giving ones self over to passion is to be ruled by passion and no longer reason that 's bondage to be controlled by your emotions and not your mind if homosexuals do n't choose to be that way , why then can so many walk away from that lifestyle and never go back their high suicide rate is because of people like you who tell them they ca n't change when they really want to that leads to depression and eventually suicide that 's not a very loving thing to do on moral relativism if that 's true then it 's just your personal preference and why should i like what you do about legislation what else do you base law on other than what you believe to be right but why is it ok to base them on your morals and not mine \? i think the state should remain neutral on sex ed after all it is the parents responsibility , not the states because when the state does it , they are pushing their morality on others who do n't agree with it and using my money to do it and that is wrong about abortion legislation , which this debate is all about the state has already ruled on this issue , murder is illegal and should be roe vs wade simply stripped a whole class of people protection under that law and denied them rights we all enjoy so again the question on abortion is what is it \?

jeez , i do n't know what i'm more disappointed in your poor grammar or the fact that i understood that perfectly a person 's profession has nothing to do with their ability to control themselves unless she 's being raped for money , then shes exercising self control by being a prostitute what are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions \? i do n't care women could get abortions as a hobby for all i care , i do n't need to justify abortion to myself to allow others to do it , i'm not as egotistical as you how many abortions results in death of the mother yearly \? again , i do n't care and it does n't matter it 's their choice they 're making the risk , not you , not i it 's none of out business why does the very people who say the government should stay out of their business are the very ones that wants the government to pay for the abortion especially if they are on welfare \? when did i say this \? i did n't , because it 's not my position try again if you say you do n't care or you avoid these questions then you are clearly showing that your level of knowledge in this area is based on merely your opinions and not facts or it means you 're an idiot and you ca n't tell the difference between relevant facts and appeals to emotion authority anyone can pull up an infinite amount of facts , it mean nothing if they are n't relevant though , it 's cute how you thought writing this would somehow convince me to answer all your questions as though they were relevant xd if we law students would do what you just did in a debate we would be disqualified you keep saying law student like being a law student matters it does n't and i do n't care if someone would disqualify you for what i 've done because 1 it 's irrelevant to this debate and 2 i happen to know for a fact that calling non sequiter on an opponent during a debate is not only allowed , but frequently taken advantage of so , either you are a liar or your debating league is full of idiots judging by your argument thus far the former seems much more likely last night we concluded as debate on hitler on whether he was innocent or not and which we agreed that he was innocent and came out on the wining end why did you write this \? it has nothing to do with anything either of us has written well , we decided that hitler was innocent last night , therefore abortion is wrong ! lt lt does this make sense to you \? \? \? or are you purposefully using non sequiters in an attempt to distract me from your paper thin argument \?","well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument \? you never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right why do n't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not \? is it because you are denying the fact \? the whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences if you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case and the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you \? who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter \? me or you \? you are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth if you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name \? is that all you can say you came up with it \? because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion really \? but i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them \? i do n't want them to be grateful to me , i want that child to be grateful to me a life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think if i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams \? would i and end up coming out on the winning end \? because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument you think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating you said a district attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why do n't you try becoming one first and them judge them , and that is if you can ever become one really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change \? if that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from and lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning come on use your head and not only your eyes do i have to explain everything to you \?",+1,-1,0

it ca n't be survival of the human species , were doing that quite well so what then is it if it 's not survival of the human species \? maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong , maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it","because that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society we have executions we execute murderers these are actually not kids but adults so we do kill people and i fully support it gassing six million jews was wrong even if the germans thought it was good well , arbitrarily exterminating a race of people goes against human survival if you were to see someone gunned downed i seriously do n't think you are saying to yourself hey , we as a society need that person you therefore should n't do that no i think not , your gut reaction is whoa ! that 's not right what the you 're absolutely right but you fail to see that our gut reaction is our subconsciousness and in its own language , it 's saying hey , survival of the species is at stake here ! level of development you 're exceptionally thick , so i'm not hoping to get through to you at all i'm simply hoping you 'd one day wake up how is a fetus not the same as person in the park \? well let 's see if the mother suffers a heavy fall or gets a bad virus , the fetus may well be naturally aborted and may no longer be , hell , sometimes it simply takes a little bit of stress felt by the mother for the fetus to be aborted naturally a person in the park however , takes a hell of a lot more to end why are there still laws against murder \? and why are there hospitals \? why did the president just pass a massive health care reform bill \? if we are in no danger whatsoever of being extinct what are we so concerned about \? if our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions \? it ca n't be survival of the human species , were doing that quite well so what then is it if it 's not survival of the human species \? maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong , maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it yes , human lives are valuable , but like i said , we 're in no danger of extinction all these measures such as laws against murder , hospitals , national health care , etc are preliminary steps laws to mandate the saving of every possible human fetus would probably be the last thing to do this may be necessary if something all of a sudden killed 90 of humans on earth , for example",-1,+1,0

abortion,"about ad hominem , let 's say all the nasty things about me are true and much worse what does that tell us about my claim \? nothing it only says something about me and is therefore irrelevant to the question at hand so what if i'm logically unsound and have obvious character weaknesses \?

but to my question can i kill it your answer tells me that you instinctively know that there is something inherently wrong with murder and that it ought not be done you recognize that there is something about murder that makes it wrong and that wrongness is a characteristic of the act and not the peoples opinion of it gassing six million jews was wrong even if the germans thought it was good you know that and so do i but if that is the case then your premise of morals and righteousness being about survival of the species would be false because the wrongness of the act proceeds our perception of it and is independent of us it is objectively wrong and further more how did it come to be that survival of the species was the good to be obtained \? because in your scheme it could have been otherwise in your scheme it would appear to be that there really is no such thing as the good or the wrong because if your correct , like ive said , we could have just as well decided that killing grown kids is a good thing but when we see kids butchered or any other injustice in the world something cries out within us that what we see is wrong and we know its wrong because we know there is a good from which it deviates and your definition of that good \( survival of the human species \) is woefully inadequate to account for that kind of reaction because if you were to see someone gunned downed i seriously do n't think you are saying to yourself hey , we as a society need that person you therefore should n't do that no i think not , your gut reaction is whoa ! that 's not right what the we do n't make laws to make things wrong , we make laws because we know that somethings are inherently wrong , they are wrong in and of themselves , like murder , theft and disrespecting people especially our elders but what i think is more telling is the way you discriminate on the basis of level of development notice how you use the phrase grown kid so i ask you whats the difference between a human in the womb and a human at the park \? level of development the terms fetus and grown child describe the stages of development in the life of a human in this case so when the life of a human is unjustly taken be it at 1 month after conception , 1 month after birth or 10 years of age it is wrong , thats called moral clarity thats why the question can i kill it is so clarifying its the last word , it , that makes all the difference what is it , is an ontological question im not asking the question , whats its stage of development that would be absurd to answer the question that way you would never answer your kid that way hey daddy , can i kill it \? well son , how old is it , you know the younger the better but thats how you try and answer the question of abortion i keep asking , what is it that we are killing \? and you keep telling me how old it is , well its just at the fetus stage ok , so what is it \?

abortion,the first question that needs to be asked is what kind of life is it \? if it is a human life then no reason for abortion is adequate therefore no further questions are needed that is an example of what is called jumping to conclusions you have not established that it abortion is never justified even if it is agreed \( which i do agree with you \) that it is a human life,"ok let me clarify , but let me say i'm not sure why you are pushing this point , but my guess is that it has something to do with authority and you want to make a point about that so let me modify what i said the reasons commonly given for abortions are in adequate in the case that the mothers life is endangered , it should be the case that the attending physician should make every attempt and exhaust every means possible to save the life of mother and child , abortion should never be considered as an easy out , quick fix or money saving option , but if it comes down to it , i think every mother would lay down their lives for their children , it 's the most humane thing to do and the most loving to lay down your life on behalf of someone else so even in this case i would still maintain that it should not be an option and i think it would be hard to give an adequate reason why the child 's life should be taken and not the mothers i think this maintains the sanctity of the child 's life throughout and at this point the moral dilemma moves from the child into other areas and the husband and wife should make the call , if circumstances necessitate it",+1,+1,1

you are comparing the two wrongly war is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself even if i were to accept that the unborn baby is a person \( which is a view that i do not necessarily agree with , as i 've explained above \) , then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life threatening illness ! well obviously you do n't think life is sacredyour pro abortion lol i'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour that just goes to show how frivolous you are what a hypocrite and , by the way , i do n't think human life is sacred and i do n't believe in the sanctity of human life if you think that life is sacred , then you , by logical deduction , should not be able to eat anything that has life \( i e animals and even vegetables and fruits \) its nine short monthsto do what is rightto allow something to live you are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through during the nine short months furthermore , you said allow something to live , right \? if the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother , then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the mother to live if you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby , are you doing what is right \? after conception it is a separate human being it is not as i have explained , the baby is not a human being within the first trimester furthermore , the unborn baby , no matter at any stage , is dependent on it 's mother completely for nutrition in other words , the baby is , technically speaking , a parasite the oxford english dictionary defines a parasite as biol an animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism \( technically called its host \) and draws its nutriment directly from it also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others , but not at their expense \( strictly called commensal or symbiotic \) also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance , as the cuckoo , the skua gull , etc thus , by definition , the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body at the expense of her own health how barbaric and cold is that \? which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not or whether it should be legal or not this is simply an appeal to emotion it should not matter whether the child will make it or not then , whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you pro choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision they do not promote abortion , simply the legalisation of abortion if you ca n't see the difference , then you 're an idiot abortion is premeditated killing and so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live if the mother 's life is threatened by the pregnancy , by not aborting the child , you are also premeditating the killing of the mother thus , by your standards , you face a paradox i am appalled by how people can call themselves pro life when they say that the mother 's life does n't matter as long as the baby is not aborted this is hypocrisy of the greatest degree most pro aborts say abortion is good becausethe child might have problemsmight grow up in povertymight face lives trials i am not a pro abort i am pro choice , as i have explained the difference so do n't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life so full of misery that they would be better off dead you are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery thus , you are attacking a straw man poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been allowed to survive face you said this again , not necessarily i support abortion only when a foetus ca n't be confidently said to lack rationality , autonomy and self consciousness now wait one minute here can a newborn baby do any of these \? no of course it does it has autonomy and self consciousness but then again , even if i agree with you , by saying that a newborn baby ca n't have such experiences , it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral thus , your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand are you telling me that you want abortion legal because the woman has a right to her own body the short answer is yes , but the long answer is no congratulations , you have proven that you at least have some level of intelligence",i did not say that having a baby was an accident your entire argument fails if we apply the same standard to any accident so either 1 \) you do indeed think it is an accident or 2 \) your analogy fails as it is being compared to a straw man i think that you 'll find yourself to be wrong there how so \?

yes i do because that is a solution to quell inheritable diseases in our species that produce members that cannot add anything to society , let alone enjoy a standard of independent life \( this view applies to major disabilities , i am undecided on minor diseases that produce somewhat capable members \) as of iq , i would love to be rid of stupid people but stupidity supplies the labor of current society i guess so not much can be done there abortion prevents unwanted children well first off there is no such thing as an unwanted child there are people that adopt children every day and there are children that grow up in an orphanage , tormented by the fact that not only did their parents not want them , nobody else did either that is a foundation of an unstable mind that could result in something very bad abortion increases happy family rates well if you think murder and killing make you happy then , that alone says a lot about a character of someone it increases happy family rates by keeping the family unit at a desired number abortion tears families apart abortion can affect a woman mentally for the rest of her life it can cause shame , anquish and psychological trauma not only for her but for the father , children even grandparents if they know about the abortion most women who have had an abortion never tell anyone because of the stigma , because they know what they have done if you think living with abortion is easy then you have another thing coming we will never know statistically how many women suffer because most do not get help , most do not come forward and share the stigma you refer to only exists due to the unfortunate inescapable entity that is religion and if living with an abortion is hard , then living with a child you ca n't take care of is harder my evidence for that last statement being me and my mother studies show that what i am saying is true not disputing what you are saying is true , just disputing the meaning and reason behind it if you would like a list of many studies would be happy to fork them over the statistics however few i have presented are more or less citations from my private political theory professor hollis wish i knew her first name but never felt the need to until years after being taught where are you getting the information that abortion increases the level of education \? again a loose citation but this one is more obvious in countries with a higher reproduction rate then normal almost always live in poverty or at the very least a low standard of living bangladesh anyone \? however , in countries with a normal or even lower then normal reproduction rate , the level of education is much higher , and that is n't by any means hard to justify eighteen percent of u s women obtaining abortions are teenagers those aged 15 17 obtain 6 of all abortions , teens aged 18 19 obtain 11 , and teens under age 15 obtain 0 4 women in their twenties account for more than half of all abortions women aged 2024 obtain 33 of all abortions , and women aged 25 29 obtain 24 xno w this age group would be out of high school and college , most are not even in school about 61 of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children okay \? i also believe in using abortion as a birth control , although the pill seems a much better option to me abortion is not cheap and they obviously did n't learn by the first abortion well repetition is the way to learn i guess not the highest education group you think by having an abortion these womens educational level will go up \? no i said the educational level of the family unit goes up , which is true , due to the fact that when you are n't forced to pay for the schooling of a kid you did n't want , then you have much more to get better schooling for a kid you did want most abortion clinics are in poorer neightborhoods because it was set up that way sanger was a racist and she though blacks were inferior \( hitler admired her and agrees which history can attest to that \) so she targeted them specifically she talked at kkk meetings encouraging its members to target blacks the negro project , eugenic plan for blacks read them they will tell you all about her racism i do n't care about her being racist racism is just a held view , no different then holding a preference over pulp or pulp free in your orange juice in the field of political theory , in which i have a considerable holding , racism does n't exist , only racial preference which actually for the sake of argument increases effectiveness among a people attack that if you must , but bear in mind i still have not indicated whether or not i have a preference , so do n't waste too much time on it the marriage bed is the most degenerating influence in the social order , sanger said it is quite the negative influence when we consider the very structure of the human mind mixed with the animalistic side of our species that society strives so hard to contain , but that is a part of society not likely too change she was about forced abortion and mass sterilization for blacks she was an inspiration to hitler and obviously her views still guide pp and others like you today i am not for forced abortion or mass sterilization of blacks , i merely hold that abortions are a greatly positive thing in society and should n't by any means be discouraged i do n't care much about racial differences except how they pertain to statistics involving the economy and like i said before , i may agree with some parts of a persons beliefs and not the other just because i may or may not agree with some similarly held beliefs of margaret sanger does not mean i by any means am inspired by her your thinking is dangerous to society you presume to know what is good for society and that good has all to do with killing both hitler and sanger believed what you are saying look where hitlers worldview took him and the others he mass murdered dangerous \? no more so then religion is at least my danger is in the name of logical progression of society and whether or not you see it that way is irrelevant you seem to refer to hitler in most of your debates , i believe mao zedong would be a much better example for the logic you are using , just a suggestion i find what you say about men and abortion commical i am certainly praying at this point you have no children and wo n't i can only imagine how they would be raised i be a wonderful dad , i would let them grow their own beliefs on god and structure , those things are up to them to figure out my duty would be protection and learning of basic functions it is not my place in my standing to dictate how my child views thing in the world around him if he wants to be pro life , all the power to him , as long as he \( or she \) truly believes in what the hold i am fine you say the woman should have the say and then you want to be excused from parenting if its your sperm that impregnated the woman and you dont want the baby ahhhh you poor thing not included yes i do believe that i do n't think he should be able to back out if he decides to pay child support , but i do believe he should have a choice that is probably the most destructive belief i have portrayed , but to win some you gotta give some , and the women won rights to chose whether or not they have an abortion libertarian worldview all about themselves , nothing about anyone else a cold cold unliveable philiosophy of life liberty for your kind is slavery , killing those they think are unworthy to live freedom of expression for you people is the gun pointed at someones head no absolutes people just doing what they want to do even if it hurts society , even if it hurts their own family that is incorrect to the extreme but i am not here to argue my party standings i could go on about your religion and get quite insulting , but for the sake of argument i hope you will drop your attacks on the libertarian party and respect us for our views as i have respected you without insult \( if one has slipped through the cracks i apologize , but i do n't remember making an insult \) your views are radical and your right you dont care about anything moral that speak to your conscience and lack of one for you rape could be good in some circumstances and well we know your all for killing those that you dont think deserve to live god only knows who is in that group yes they are radical , i am not going to deny that and there is no such thing as moral or right or wrong i think in terms such as beneficial and destructive and god does n't know because he does n't exist i may seem colder then usually imaginable , but when faced with issue such as abortion we must think about what is best for society and i am actually quite the party animal , but here i am here to be logical and maybe have a beer when done your worldview is not logical at all in fact i find it hidiously evil and dangerous it strips away the preciousness of life and living what a sad world you live in which is why those that value life need to keep you close it is logical as all my views come from a deep understanding of political theory and my understanding of what makes the human mind and what differentiates it from that of an animal \( not much \) no such thing as evil , said that already and you misunderstand my intentions in benefiting society we promote what makes us human progression , thinking , in making society a better place we make the world a better place and my world is sad by no means i seek only to progress my knowledge and thoughts of world issues i thank you for having the courtesy of making a quite lengthy response",so if one of your children got a disease or became handicapped would you hire the killing done or would you do it yourself \? you said society would be better without people such as this i assume you meant your family as well right \?,+1,-1,0
abortion,"\( headdesk \) i hate these for against debates about abortion abortion is not one sided ! both radical sides of the argument are full of idiocy ! which of course is why i have a totally neutral opinion abortion is totally okay up until a certain , and totally unacceptable after a certain point","hear ! hear ! i 'd add that it is not the defining moral issue of the day since it 's only like 15 of the population making tons of noise about it , the same people who always make a bunch of noise about settled issues , but for some reason every rep listens to that 15 but why make it more confusing than it has to be \? good answer",+1,+1,1
abortion,"if you are saying that because we believe abortion is wrong then we are taking the rights of americans then what about the rights of the child as a developing human too \? is n't that an american too \? its not an american till it 's born so my answer to you is should we pay rapists not to commit rapes and cause unwanted pregnancies too \? no , they should pay them causing unwanted pregnancies is just as bad as people that would deny a woman an abortion people taking away the right to have an abortion screw the morals your thinking about you are trying to take away someone 's right that 's another common thing with gun control , people are trying to take away other people 's rights you are taking the rights of the citizens of america you sir , are the kind of people who send our country down the drain","really \? then why do n't you try telling that to the laws that prevents a woman from prostitutions , suicide or use of drugs does n't these laws prevent a woman from controlling her body \? arent the laws taking away the rights of a woman here \? and further more why do n't you check up on the statistics of woman with repeat abortions , yearly death of the mothers from abortion , effects of abortion on a mother and also the horrific methods of abortion",+1,-1,0
abortion,"you obviously feel killing is ok , i do not i have never made this claim you are putting words in my mouth you do n't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion that is because i do n't think abortion is wrong in every circumstance i think some people have the wrong motivations to abort a baby and or under the wrong medical circumstances , making some abortion cases morally wrong i give it personhood but the idea of personhood is something that you have not defined clearly if you want to argue on the basis of personhood , then a baby within the first trimester does n't even have a brain to speak of it , therefore , does n't have the ability to feel , let alone reason , within the first trimester war is about protection how can the unborn fight for its protection \? you are comparing the two wrongly war is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself even if i were to accept that the unborn baby is a person \( which is a view that i do not necessarily agree with , as i 've explained above \) , then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life threatening illness ! well obviously you do n't think life is sacredyour pro abortion lol i'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour that just goes to show how frivolous you are what a hypocrite and , by the way , i do n't think human life is sacred and i do n't believe in the sanctity of human life if you think that life is sacred , then you , by logical deduction , should not be able to eat anything that has life \( i e animals and even vegetables and fruits \) its nine short monthsto do what is rightto allow something to live you are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through during the nine short months furthermore , you said allow something to live , right \? if the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother , then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the mother to live if you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby , are you doing what is right \? after conception it is a separate human being it is not as i have explained , the baby is not a human being within the first trimester furthermore , the unborn baby , no matter at any stage , is dependent on it 's mother completely for nutrition in other words , the baby is , technically speaking , a parasite the oxford english dictionary defines a parasite as biol an animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism \( technically called its host \) and draws its nutriment directly from it also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others , but not at their expense \( strictly called commensal or symbiotic \) also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance , as the cuckoo , the skua gull , etc thus , by definition , the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body at the expense of her own health how barbaric and cold is that \? which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not or whether it should be legal or not this is simply an appeal to emotion it should not matter whether the child will make it or not then , whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you pro choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision they do not promote abortion , simply the legalisation of abortion if you ca n't see the difference , then you 're an idiot abortion is premeditated killing and so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live if the mother 's life is threatened by the pregnancy , by not aborting the child , you are also premeditating the killing of the mother thus , by your standards , you face a paradox i am appalled by how people can call themselves pro life when they say that the mother 's life does n't matter as long as the baby is not aborted this is hypocrisy of the greatest degree most pro aborts say abortion is good becausethe child might have problemsmight grow up in povertymight face lives trials i am not a pro abort i am pro choice , as i have explained the difference so do n't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life so full of misery that they would be better off dead you are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery thus , you are attacking a straw man poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been allowed to survive face you said this again , not necessarily i support abortion only when a foetus ca n't be confidently said to lack rationality , autonomy and self consciousness now wait one minute here can a newborn baby do any of these \? no of course it does it has autonomy and self consciousness but then again , even if i agree with you , by saying that a newborn baby ca n't have such experiences , it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral thus , your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand are you telling me that you want abortion legal because the woman has a right to her own body the short answer is yes , but the long answer is no congratulations , you have proven that you at least have some level of intelligence","i doubt that you can suggest that parents who use contraception are irresponsible if they are not prepared for the consequences , then yes it possess the dna of a homo sapien , no doubt but it is not a homo sapien wel \? do n't leave me hangin' did n't i say that i agree it is alive \? you added a technically in there which expressed hesitance and some doubt but this is a good start we are human life apparently we are stuck at the human homo sapien part you are committing the genetic fallacy here haha get it \? genetic fallacy \? no ok puns aside , how \? for example , the colloquial definition of a theory and a scientific definition of a theory are completely different i do n't accept your givens to be true in other words , does it possess rationality , autonomy and self consciousness \?

abortion,"murder is a legal definition it is the unlawful killing of another human being thus abortion is not murder shooting a burglar is taking someone 's life without permission however that is not murder either the right to bodily sovereignty should be absolute what right is more basic that control over our own body you have the right not have an operation , or medical care or drugs you also have the right not to forcible donate blood , or organs , or risk your life to save another all pregnancy carries risks to life and health , the fetus uses the mother 's blood and organs she has a right to stop their use can she abort in the 9th month \? no , but she should have the right to evict she has control of her body , not the fetuses","it 's ironic that a woman can hire someone to kill her unborn , but should she do it herself , be charged with a crime why is this \? the fetus was once recognized as a person in our country but after 1973 it lost its identity and was put up on the chopping block , the bullseye was placed on every unborn fetus 's forehead you talk about bodily sovereignty i would assume you mean the right for a woman to abort at any time during the pregnancy since she certainly keeps her own body throughout the term this means any woman because she has sole ownership of her body can decide what to do with it , even kill in the ninth month am i right \? is that what you are saying \? pregnancy is not dangerous to 99 of those doing it less than 1 of all women getting abortions do it because of health issues and in most case both mother and baby can be saved so most woman abort because of social issues having a baby is a natural thing to do many women do not even go to doctors to be watched and have no problems at all so do n't make the statement that it carries risks above and beyond what pregnancy implies how many woman die a year in childbirth compared to those who have successful pregnancies \? not many you are saying two things in your statement she owns her body , but she does n't can she abort in the 9th month \? no but she should have the right to abort abortion kills if that is what she wants to do , to kill it even in the ninth month , what right do you have then based on what you have said here to deny her the right \?",+1,-1,0
abortion,"this is stupid the simple fact of all of this is let people decide what they want to do with teir bodies , i am so sick of republicans saying no more government then they have these rules which make more decisions for us total hypocrisy you have a right to choose is my stance on everything","i wrote this speech read it and it will answer your questions abortion choose life it begins at conception think about this a girl had an abortion , thinking that the baby wasnt living so it wouldnt matter but , after she had the abortion , she saw what she thought wasnt living , and it actually was the baby was living and she watched it die from then on , she couldnt even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being this story that i just told you is true a lot of women think that it isnt a baby before they have the abortion , and i will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby well , if life doesnt begin at birth , then when does it begin \? life begins at conception this is a fact , because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up for example , there is scientific proof and there is biblical proof to further explain what abortion is , i will talk about these important things one , it is spiritually right that life begins at conception , two , how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception , three , what we can do about the abortions , and finally , why girls get abortions those are all the things that should be thought about , so i will be explaining them , to help you understand them some woman have abortions because of these three things one , they might think that theyre too young to have a baby , two , their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion , three , if they do have the abortion the girls parents would get mad at her the case also might be that she just doesnt want to deal with the baby first , you probably ought to know what abortion is abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant every year 1 5 million babies are killed by abortion thats 125 , 000 babies killed a month , making it 4 , 000 babies killed each day , or one baby killed every 20 seconds , that is so amazingly awful that is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds how brutal the fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right as it says in the bible jeremiah 1 5 says , before i formed you in the womb , i knew you , before you were born i set you apart the bible says that life begins at conception , meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being there are many bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception , like the one i just said that bible verse , jeremiah 1 5 is saying that god intended a unique human being , starting at conception just because you cant see or feel the baby inside of you , doesnt mean its not a baby , and alive and a human being , just like you that is what a lot of people do not think about , even though you really should there also is scientific proof some people may think that life begins at birth , or some people even later , but that is wrong , life begins at conception because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception , then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being for example , the heart beat starts gradually , over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life also , dna defines a separate human being , and so when does a person form their own dna \? a person gets their own dna at conception that is a whole lot of proof , so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old , so why isnt it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mothers womb \? that is a question that probably will go unanswered forever , or they will just say that the baby is not living , which is a complete lie now , what can we do about abortion \? there many things that we can do about abortion if you start supporting this pro life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down , and the law will have to change but , most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion , and save the innocent little babies now , how can we stop abortion \? there are many ways to help stop abortion another way is you can donate money to a place like the pregnancy resource center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion you can also write to the president or another government representative , and tell them about all this proof that i have told you , hoping that their hearts will change and then the law in conclusion to all of this , it is spiritually right that life begins at conception , and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception there are many ways that you can help stop abortion , so i hope that you take a while and do that there are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion , so you really should not have one just remember that god loves the person getting the abortion and the beautiful , innocent little babies thank you and i hope that you have realized that life begins at conception , you should help the pro life movement , and that having an abortion is wrong words 981",+1,-1,0

what makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies \? death penalty gives us the right to decide whether someone dies or lives at war , soldiers constantly decide whether innocent enemy soldiers and civilians should live or die so , human beings are given the right to kill others i could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts but would it really matter or affect your views on abortion \? you did not state any proof you only quoted doctors who agree with you i have one last question do the rights of an embryo outweigh the rights of woman \?",-1,+1,0

abortion,the true cause of this 'burden' is the irresponsibilty of idiots which lead to elective abortion the second major issue i have with your distastefully anti human post is that you think a human being is only a human being after it has been born that is scientifically speaking utter garbage revealing a lack of understanding about human biology abortion is murder pure and simple i am no christian incidently my premise is entirely logical,"the true cause of this 'burden' is the irresponsibilty of idiots which lead to elective abortion you know , this is actually a common thread amongst conservatives , especially the fundamentalists for example , they are against hpv and hiv vaccines and cures because they believe these diseases are deserved punishments for \( in their view \) immoral behaviour they are against contraception because that removes the consequences they believe ought to follow from sex out of wedlock they are against abortion because an unexpected newborn to them is some form of life lesson for \( in their view \) immoral behaviour and it is essentially punishment for the rest of us , i suppose that holding a person 's future in your hands and choosing to ruin their lives as some sort of moral lesson designed to teach that the arbitrary morals held by a particular group are rules of nature , is frankly ghastly the second major issue i have with your distastefully anti human post is that you think a human being is only a human being after it has been born that is scientifically speaking utter garbage revealing a lack of understanding about human biology just to set the record straight , i have no emotional issue with infanticide or homicide if it has a rational basis quite frankly , the newborn brain is still simple enough that i see no moral dilemma if the newborn must die for a rational reason i set the ethical cut off point at birth for the sake of convenience creating an ultimate test of sentience and consciousness and then applying it to a large sample of foetuses as they mature and are birthed in order to definitively answer when a newborn has a mind capable of thought and awareness that we would call human is a task that is presently beyond us further it forgets that abortion is and always was the personal choice of the mother , since it is her body , and rationality dictates that an adult mind ought to have priority when compared to a developing mind abortion is murder pure and simple i am no christian incidently my premise is entirely logical murder is the unauthorised \( illegal \) killing of an individual a foetus is not an individual \( it has no sense of self or identity caused by unique memories \) , and it is not illegal to kill them therefore it is not murder have you ever seen a foetus \?",-1,+1,0

abortion,"1 this is not always the case there are some forms of retardation in which they never achieve these i personally know of one little girl who has massive brain damage and will never be able to fit your description people in comatose \( if we follow your definition of personhood \) lose their personhood upon going comatose they cannot gain knowledge , exercise wisdom , love others , find purpose , or integrate into society now the incredible irony of all of this is that the fetus can do all of these things given the chance if on your view these people are persons because they have the potential of doing these things , how is the fetus not a person having the equal potential of doing these things \? 2 reproduction in the sense of simple life just means the ability to replicate oneself in some manner it 's not sexual reproduction , no , but that 's not what the definition refers to otherwise single celled organisms which reproduce asexually would n't be considered alive clarification i am against abortion in all but life or death cases at that point i think the doctor needs to make the call and save either the mother or the baby the moral landscape is such at that point that it 's permissible to take action one way or the other because the doctor is sworn to do everything he can to keep his patient alive","just a little request please use the bold feature for disputes , rather than listing points to do so , type 2 asterisks , then your text , then close it with 2 asterisks , like using speech marks it makes it easier to see exactly what you 're disputing thanks newborns are not independent of their natural host i think it 's quite obvious that once the umbilical cord is cut , it is independent of its host left alone they will die of thirst well , so will anything i do n't see what relevance this poses a fetus can become independent if it is given the time to mature into a child and then an adult yes , but it is n't a fetus then i'm not a 13 year old fetus a fetus cannot survive independently until the third trimester , when abortion is illegal however most fetuses will be able to if given time \( they grow into children and then adults \) see above you 're looking at a fetus as a separate entity from a human , but it is just the beginning growth stage of a human but at this point , it 's extremely difficult to say that it is truly human a fetus can do these things once it grows to be a child just as a child can do more things once it becomes an adult see my first point f this were the case , you 'd be dead in a few hours your body is constantly reproducing cells to replace dying ones sexual reproduction is a very tiny , tiny percentage of the reproduction the human body is engaged in i do understand this what i mean is , the way a human passes it 's genes down is through sexual reproduction a fetus cannot do this , thus scientifically , it is not fully human i have a friend who is asexual due to a birth defect where her womb never developed firstly , i would like to say how little knowledge i have on this subject so if i say anything stupid or offensive , it 's nothing malicious , just ignorant ok , i 'll accept that she is asexual but she ca n't reproduce asexually , right \? meaning she has no reproductive capability if she was able to reproduce , it would be sexually , not asexually \? if so , my point still stands a fetus cannot sexually reproduce because it has not begun developing sexual organs yet \( but it has the dna plans to and is working on it \) i like that analogy so i 'll give my own spin a builder asks you if you want a new kitchen fitted for free obviously , you agree you 're very considerate and respectful to the builder , as he 's doing it for free you give him tea , coffee , breaks , all the perks he wants a day later , you ask him how he 's doing with the kitchen he hands you the blueprints , and says , i'm working on it i for one , would be seething if i had given that man perks for doing absolutely nothing builderly like whatsoever and i would also be incensed if i had to give full human rights to something that is n't human yet , just working on it newborns certainly do n't have all the biological features of an adult how does this affect their humanity \? a newborn is independent of its host a fetus is not able to be until the third trimester nay it is not the baby 's fault that the mother was raped , so she has no right to harm it but it 's not the mother 's fault she was raped the rapist had no right to harm her the difference between an adult woman and a fetus , is that the woman is , without a doubt , entitled to human rights the right to choose what she does with her body the fact that the fetus' rights are in doubt , lets the woman take precedent nay this is unfortunate , but if it is not life or death , how is there any justification in killing the baby \? the right to choose nay again this is unfortunate , but how can we presume to know if the baby wants to live or not \? if this were acceptable , the retarded , disfigured , and elderly people could be killed along the same line of reasoning i 'll accept that one nothing , read my response to this i must say , that was a very refreshing and innovative take on the question",-1,+1,0

i would n't have an abortion personally just because i think other people have the right does n't mean i 'd do it myself the only reason i 'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child i bring up hitler because margaret sanger influenced him and she was the founder of planned parenthood your views on this mirror theirs because they acted them out do some research and you will see google sanger and hitler then see if you agree with them if you do n't i would like to know what you disagree with them on are you fucking kidding me \? here is one of margaret 's views advocate abortions on afro americans in order to eliminate what she called socially undesirable people so i'm a racist now \? and there is a massive difference here for a start i do n't believe anyone should be forced to have an abortion it 's their choice and another she called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers , and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf , blind and dependent she condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries , and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy sanger 's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die i do n't agree with anything this woman promoted or believed she did n't believe woman had the right to choose abortion she wanted to force them without a choice she is racist scum and i have no common ground with any of these views this is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of how dare you \?

a date i randomly made up \? no the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands and the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science , i linked you the information but it 's clear you obviously do n't read half of what people try to say to you which is where i get my opinion on when i think abortion is okay it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb if i had no worth for the womb why would i have a child \?","no my dear you do not obviously know the law our government says the child belongs to her , that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy without any confirmation from him he does not even have to know , even if he is the father if he was recognized as a player the law would not be what it is today nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either that is the law the fact is , the baby is hers at conception she took the risk the sperm leaves his body and enters her his part is done the sperm was a gift , he certainly cant ask for it back can he \? lol she holds the cards and has him by the you know what that is if he wants the baby , because whether he wants it or not its not an issue of course i am a christian and do n't believe it should be this way , but that is the law today i believe personally that the man should be considered that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion like i said today she can kill and he need not even know it i talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs you said its unfair why \? you are trying to make yourself feel better look better you are pro choice and believe the option should be there remember consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing you said , it 's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful christian you are ! why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore the man is just as responsible for pregnancy he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant your opinion is sexist is so many levels am i calling names \? didnt you call me a pig \? better reread that section am i insulting you because you are pro abortion \? well gee i am sorry , the truth hurts you said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonthat abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it now if the way i described it sounds crasssorry , but i was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made most abortions happen on unwed women women mainly who profess to be christian in fact that does not change the fact how they got pregnant why dont you describe it for us in more politically correct terms \? it still wont change the truth of how it happened as i said again the man is an onlooker so says the law that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in is that better way to put it \? you are absolutely unbelievable you want to blameand blame you do , for what is a womans issue , so says the law what do you not get \? dont you have the guts to call it like it is \? if the man is accountable wouldnt he have a decision in the pregnancy \? no the government says no he is not an issue and he is not responsible as for condemning anyone for an abortionthis discussion is not about that i work with women who have had abortions because i know what its like , i had one i was one of those women who spread her legs it was my call , my responsibility and the pain and agony i suffered was on me as it should be so dont tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through the work i do is in this field , i see the pain , especially afterwards and guess what the pain is just not experienced by the woman , but by the boyfriends , the husbands the children the woman calls the shots as i did when i had mine some thirty years ago i would give anything to be able to take that day backand i know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way you are pro choice whether you want to believe it or notbecause you simply condone others the right to kill were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into hitlers ovens pro life \? how about those people that owned slaves \? would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one \? and do you have to use the f bomb in order to debate \? is it an effective way to get your point across \? of course you will retaliateyou condone abortion which is violence you ranted onyou are a vile , horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this how dare you say i contribute to abortion if a woman asked me if she should have an abortion i 'd say 'it 's up to you , it 's your choice' i would n't judge her , i would n't influence her opinion if someone is considering an abortion than they are n't anti abortion anyway and pro abortionists existing wo n't mean diddly squat to their decision i was making an analogy that you simply did not like well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute \? how about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull \? if someone drives someone to a robbery and they are caught does the police just say ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye \? i mean come on if you refused to take her to the abortion , she might not get it if the doctor didnt show up , the nurse refuse to do itthe baby might have a chance you said , yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion , hence i think it 's okay before then pain has everything to do with it , if death was n't painful people would n't be so scared of it i do n't have to be entirely pro abortion just like i would n't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance i would like if my daughter was starving i 'd steal food for her without a second thought again thanks for the insult , what a wonderful christian you are you can act self righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people , demeaning them and being downright rude not to mention you lie very godly youre so ridiculous its not even funny bolongamany people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it not just because of pain insult \?

no case for abortion can be made scripturally christ would want me to stand up the his little children , he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin , devastated my life until i came to him so you dont like how i put things christ said , they hated me first and will hate you as well i am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth you might be the greatest person in the world , but you are pro abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice you are not for and against you are for because you think it should be legal you said , is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it 's money \? you 're wrong , having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing , his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is if you 're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you 're obviously very wrong i said , if a woman and man are marriedhe cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion he has no rights even though it is his child but he would be held legally responsible for child support if he did not want the child and wanted her to get an abortion she calls the shots now if they were not married , she cant hold him financially accountable for anything the baby is hers , unless she puts his name on the birth certificateand in that case he might for forced to pay you said , what \?

you value your own child and do n't care about another in the womb \? \? \? \? \? yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks , right \?",+1,-1,0

i'm not , the mother of the child is and if she ca n't feed herself let alone provide for a child and she decides to abort that 's her choice and perhaps a sensible one you have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live funny your saying that and you were born lol is your life perfect \?

you have read way too much into a small paragraph i wrote i simply gave reasons why a woman might choose to abort and supported that i do n't remember saying hey you there ! abort your baby it might be fat ! what makes you think that you have the right to decide for another human being whether he lives or dies \? what \? i 've never made a choice for anyone to live or die or wanted had the right it is a scientific fact that the sperm in a male is human , t is a fact that the eggs in a female is human does that mean if someone masturbates they are aborting a human life \? does that mean when a woman menstruates she is aborting a human life \? they are not human until they meet , implant and develop i could go on and on and on showing you proof about when life starts stop talking to me about conception , i 've had a child i know how it works what is the goal of every abortionist \?

abortion,"this argument has already been covered , so i do n't know why you 're repeating it but since you have , i will reply again protective sex is the act of preventing life from happening in the first place you 're preventing fertilization from happening , some view this as on the same level as abortion so since abstinence or condoms are not outlawed , neither should abortion i get you 're trying to make people realize the consequences of having unprotected sex , so what you should argue for is that unprotected sex should be banned , not abortion should be banned ! abortion is dealing with the aftermath , so let it be dealt with ! if you want to prevent , then outlaw unprotected sex make it illegal ! just like riding a bike without a helmet ! it 's illegal to ride bikes without helmets \( at least in some countries \)","this is what i derive from your argument we should not outlaw abortion , we should outlaw unprotected sex this is because we want to prevent children from coming into this earth , or kill them off should accidents happen this system is complete and utter bs , and would do more harm than good if we wanted to prevent children from being born , we should educate , and provide more condoms and help encourage abstinence among teenagers and couples this way , we can eventually move past outlawing unprotected sex and stop abortions for good what you suggest does nothing to promote any form of childbirth it does n't give a single solution that does n't cause more problems",+1,-1,0

abortion,"well you are confusing yourself now because if you are claiming abortion is not right then what is the purpose of your argument \? you 're so wrapped up in this duality you 've created you have n't even considered that my position is not one of morality i'm not for or against abortion it 's called pro choice not pro abortion you never said that it is right i agree but reading from your statement you are supporting the fact that it is right no , you 've imposed this position on me this is a matter of your prejudice , not my implication why do n't you care about whether abortion makes people more responsible or not \? is it because you are denying the fact \? i do n't care because it does n't matter i have no right to decide what is good and what is not for other people perhaps some people end up more responsible , perhaps some do n't the whole purpose of a debate is to justify and prove so i do not know where you got that idea from because again without justification then a debate based on opinion is none but a fruitless debate serving no purpose when we are supposed to educate then convince to justify and prove , eh \? a debate is a means , the purpose is invented by the individual this is still a debate whether my method is through debunking your conclusion or putting forth my own well remember you said in your first statement that it is my silly preferences if you were using your critical thinking skills you would have been able to realize that i meant you are failing to realize my facts but yet you were criticising me as i was just giving my opinions alone you seem to be under the delusion that one can derive a position from facts without forming an opinion a position without opinion is just facts , a position without facts is just opinion you need both i'm not arguing against the facts , i'm arguing against your stupidity do n't try to shift the blame onto the facts , they ca n't help what they are why do you mean how abortion started does not matter whe nit is the origin of the case because your argument is rooting in morality , mine is rooting in questioning your morality if you disagree with the origins of abortion for the same reason then it makes no difference , you 're still arguing from your personal preferences and the fact that there is a major dispute in the origin itself then start a debate how did abortion originate \? it 's another topic and does n't bare any relevance to this one look at our arguments and would you say that i am worst or you \? you would n't like my answer p who have produced facts and strenght in their arguments and who keep saying not related or does not matter \? me or you \? you are running away from my questions because you yourself knows the truth can you please get through just one sentence with proper grammar \? you can pull up facts until your fingers are worn to stubs it means nothing if they are n't relevant if you know my name is 99 then tell me what does 99 means on my name \? you totally missed the point is that all you can say you came up with it \? because you do not even have facts to justify your position but you are giving mere opinions and to me that does not matter and is irrelevant unless you can prove your opinion are you dyslexic \? that made almost no sense again , look up the term debunking but i guess they would love you for deciding that it is right for them \? again , i 've said no such thing at least try to make relevant arguments i do n't want them to be grateful to me , i want that child to be grateful to me a life and a develping human being who are the young people of our society well well , what a noble man you are placing the value of life above the value of a good life did i say noble \? i meant retarded well well i said that to illusrate what true deabting is all about and not what you think if i was a bad debater i would not have lead all of my teams \? would i and end up coming out on the winning end \? again , either you are a liar or your league is full of idiots \) because i am portraying to you what a debate is all about and what are the proper ways of responding to an argument you think you are going to convince a group of people by saying you do not care or does not matter if asked something in debate because if that is the cae then you would be a loser in debating debating 101 debunking and calling out opponents on non sequiters is how a debate works there 's no need to prove someone else 's abortion is none of my \( or your \) business debunking your reasons for being pro life does that by itself do you understand \? you said a district attorney can be stupid or childish so my advice to you is why do n't you try becoming one first and them judge them , and that is if you can ever become one 1 2 3 lt lt you understand this , right \? well , here 's a line of reasoning almost as simple and easy to comprehend district attorneys are people people can be stupid and childish therefore , district attorneys can be stupid and childish there 's no need to become a district attorney to understand that they are n't infallible really are you referring to life as in daily activities or the human life because i never know life can change \? if that was the case then the human life could have been altered to different forms everything is constantly changing you 're heart pumps fresh blood , your skin falls off and is replaced , sperms turn into zygotes etc etc etc life and death are n't opposites , they 're complementariness well the reaon i called you that is because you are building an argument filled with non supportive inforamtion and i agree i had no right to but then think of all the facts you are runnig from wrong again i'm not building an argument , i'm debunking yours there 's no running here , simply wading through the things you 've said and lastly my friend if you had strong critical thinking skills you could have simply figured out that last night we concluded a debate on hitler and if our information was merely based on opnions rather than facts we would have came out losing instead of winning come on use your head and not only your eyes do i have to explain everything to you \? nothing you just wrote changes that your hitler debate has nothing to do with this debate you could be lying about the whole thing for all i know come on use your head and not only your eyes do i have to explain everything to you \? \)","in a debate either you are for or against ask anyone that and they will tell you are you that foolish enough not to realize the difference between pro choice or in other words pro abortion or pro life or anti abortion if i recalled my opposing team was pro choice why \? because they are against abortion you seem to be lacking common sense really \? as far as i am concerned whatever a person say portrays the idea of that person as in reading a book and trying to figure out the idea or goal of the writer again you do n't care that to me is pure selfishness and lack of knowledge your debate is filled with inconsistent information filled with opinions without any evidence please do me a favor and read up on the rules of debating because according to you , you are a person of science you seem to be failing to recognize that any opinions should be built on facts please , you are a person of science one day you will stand against an opposing team face to face and then you will understand what i am talking about when you say that i am retarded lets say that a woman who intentionally has unprotected sex aware of the consequences but now goes to the extent of killing the fetus , are you implying that there is no innocence or good in that fetus \? are you saying that there is nothing wrong with that \? to me that is just selfishness well in order to debate a topic you need to know the origin of that case and then identify the weakness in that origin if it was a speech called informative speech and lets say you were referring to reasons why abortion should be made illegal then the origin would have been completely different as my professor advised me last week well actually you do not need to say who is worst or not because i have friends in pre law on here and have already taken a look at this debates and has already given me a response why are you running from the truth \? point out to one statement which you made that had an authoritative reference \? exactly when you think you know everything or do not want to know then your perception might be wrong believe me do not even make my team read this part that you said or else they would not be too happy believe me and my team comprises of at least 25 members who are excellent at debating i would suggest you stop making remarks about my team instead of me because all 25 of them would challenge you in a debate on here you are a person of denial and lack of common sense filled with ignorance you think about topics and not what the speaker is trying to convey maybe you are better off in science when you debunk do n't debunk with opinion because even an idiot knows that debunk with facts and one last thing i do not need to lie to you about what my abilities or capabilities are because i know what i have and is presently accomplishing so i would not even bother paying attention to such a foolish statement there is no law of debating that says you cannot use appeal to authority or emotions to win a debate especially if the person in question can have a huge impact on the debate you are trying to dispute check up on your book again my friend and i do not lie \? maybe you love to judge which you said you do not but your statements tells me you are incapable of taking on a person in a debate and failing to using your common sense you need people to explain everything to you and furthermore , this is not a debate this is selfishness",+1,-1,0

when she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit , her rights to her own body are being infringed upon this is self evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself you are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens a parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury there is no proof of that in a fetus for a parasitic relationship , those elements of science have to exist there is no such thing as a 'human kingdom' humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats , chimps , and mice do not assume i do n't understand what you are trying to say it just irrelevant regardless of species , the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them again , this is a parasitic relationship one organism leeches from another without returning anything some definitions include the stipulation of separate species , and others do not but either way , you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship it only takes , it does not return the claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman pregnancy is extremely taxing on the mother 's body , even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active it often leads to malnutrition , anemia , or high blood pressure , and even when it does n't do any of these things , it is still exhausting , painful , and their bodies will never be the same this is technically injury to the woman , even though in some cases it may be minor , and is completely natural if a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body , i am sure the mental toll would also be enormous but a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her dna and is equivalent to murder murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well you are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder \? a fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it the fetus having possession of the mother 's dna has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder your skin cells have your dna but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself this point is also of subjective importance do n't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone even if i did consider a fetus to be a human life , i still maintain that the mother 's rights override the rights of the fetus i would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they did n't want , effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else 's whims this sounds like a nightmare the government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they must undergo or what medical procedures they may not undergo if a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it , she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence the reason the mother is and should be culpable is that , at that point , the child can depend on someone else for life , so if she does not want the responsibility , she is able to someone who will care for the child before the fetus is viable , it cannot depend on anyone else for life , so if she does not want the responsibility , she is unable to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate , i would be all for this and if she chooses to give the child away for abortion , then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival since this is nonsense , i am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion' this does not change a single thing about my argument at this point , the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival , so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it in addition to my previous point , i would like to pose a hypothetical situation someone has a child when their child is 10 years old , he becomes gravely ill only an organ transplant will save him unfortunately , the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents for whatever reason , the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs should the government get involved and force one of the parents to give the child an organ , under threat of punishment \? if yes , why draw the line at a parent child situation \? why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list \? if no , why not \? after all , the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate , and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life a living human at the expense of their own bodies",-1,+1,0
abortion,"in my point of view , abortion should n't be banned abortion is a not bad thing for women , especially for teenagers everybody thinks that abortion is wrong , but most of those people even have n't been pregnant it is easier to talk about it and to say that women should n't have an abortion , but when it happens it is very hard to make a choice when people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong , they judge women who had an abortion we cannot judge people abortion is not very good , of course but it is not wrong it is a choice it is a choice of those women who cannot take responsibility for children because of some reasons for example , just imagine , you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant you have no husband , your boyfriend said that it is your problem your family has no money to take care for your child and you even have n't finished a school yet what would you do \? do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong \? i do n't think so you would think , even for a minute you would think about abortion what would i do in that situation \? of course , i would think a lot but if my situation was very very bad , i would have an abortion , i think of course , i would never forget about that and when i grew up and became an adult with a work , with a husband and with money i would adopt a child i can explain why abortion is a murder i agree with that but everybody has a right to be wrong everybody makes mistakes and we should n't afraid to make them we should fix our mistakes it is called a responsibility , if you do something wrong , fix it we should use this rule everywhere , as well with abortion as i said earlier , abortion is a murder and how to fix a murder \? if you killed a child , give a life for another child it is a solution for that how to fix other problems \? for example , if you stole 1000 , give somebody 1000 if you broke a tree , plant a new tree if you messed up a book in a library , apologize and buy them a new book and i said , if you killed someone , give a life for someone so , i can say that all of us make mistakes , we are not perfect nobody does but we have to think without emotions and to fix our mistakes of course , if woman has capabilities to take care for the child , it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him but if woman decided not to have a child , it is not wrong it is not good , but not wrong","when people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong , they judge women who had an abortion we cannot judge people why not \?

or for anyone to do \? for example , just imagine , you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception \? or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species \( ie sex \) \? you have no husband , your boyfriend said that it is your problem your family has no money to take care for your child and you even have n't finished a school yet what would you do \? consider birth control before i had sex now that it is too late , i would accept responsibility for my actions , or inaction as the case may be do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong \? no , i wouldnt want to end the life of the fetus because the fetus having been conceived are direct results of my irresponsibility in not using birth control or making the guy use it \( assuming we are not talking about an immaculate conception \) religious ethics based on the idea of sin or evil has no effect on my decision its about how i was raised what would i do in that situation \? of course , i would think a lot but if my situation was very very bad , i would have an abortion , i think of course , i would never forget about that and when i grew up and became an adult with a work , with a husband and with money i would adopt a child i can explain why having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire and you probably wont ever forget about that either , in fact , youll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control abortion is a murder murder is unlawful killing , abortion is legal therefore not unlawful , nor murder but everybody has a right to be wrong i dont think that its a right maybe a privilege everybody makes mistakes and we should n't afraid to make them we should fix our mistakes it is called a responsibility , if you do something wrong , fix it what about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes \? i agree that once a mistake is made , that one should fix it , but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion we should use this rule everywhere , as well with abortion so first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime \? where do we draw the line \? as i said earlier , abortion is a murder and how to fix a murder \? if you killed a child , give a life for another child it is a solution for that well no , not technically murder it is killing , but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity \? doing so may help you sleep at night , but does it really fix it \? how to fix other problems \? for example , if you stole 1000 , give somebody 1000 if you broke a tree , plant a new tree if you messed up a book in a library , apologize and buy them a new book and i said , if you killed someone , give a life for someone if a person steals , wouldnt it be fixing it to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from \? of course , if woman has capabilities to take care for the child , it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him one does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isnt able to be a good parent i am totally against abortion as a form of birth control when actions can be taken to prevent conception in the first place as for situations of rape or failed preventative birth control , i am pretty much indifferent about whether or not a woman want 's to be a mom or have an abortion i do n't care about abortion in as much as a person being responsible for their actions if people took more responsibility , then abortion would be less of an issue in the world",+1,+1,1

abortion,"yes i do , because i think clarity is more important than agreement and i'm trying to be precise in my thinking i do n't find ambiguity or equivocation very helpful in debates i ask the question because it is an ontological question and we need to know what it is that we are taking the life of asking the question of personhood does n't get us very far because it is a characteristic of the thing in question just like the word fetus is they tell us something about the thing but they do n't tell us what the thing in question is to know that requires an ontological question and that 's why i ask what is it \? and you are correct , it is human although in the early developmental stage known as fetus just like you are at the stage known as adulthood , assuming your past puberty and if not you are an adolescent and yet still fully human just like a fetus is and humans are the sort of things that have personhood it 's not what they are but a characteristic they posses now i think the question , what is it , is one you would ask instinctively what do i mean assuming you have a child , what would you say to that child if it came up behind you and asked can i kill it \? i 'd bet money that the first question of your lips would be what is it \? and if it was the fly that 's been bugging you , you would say yes and if it was the kid down the street you would say no you see your answer hinges on the question what is it and no other question i hope you can see that and the reason you would say no to killing the kid down down the street is because you know , instinctively , that humans are n't the sort of thing you just kill flippantly , it requires proper justification that 's why i oppose abortion killing humans for the sake of convenience is unjustified and evil btw insult is not an argument , it 's what you do when your position is unsound you try and discredit your opponent to make yourself look good but notice my character is unrelated to the question at hand , it has no bearing on it that my friend is known as a genetic fallacy and an ad hominem you do n't actually answer the question , you just obscure it and that 's the opposite of clarity","ad hominem \? nice one ! i gave lawnman a load of ad hominems a little while ago as well ! in my book , it 's fully justified to discredit the character of the opposition if they prove themselves to be logically unsound and are showing obvious character weaknesses by doing that , you 're showing everyone that your opposition is incapable of making sound judgements now , i think i 've read this story of the boy coming up to his father and asking can i kill it \? why \? it 's because you 've written it already in a different post ! recycling is acceptable when it comes to milk cartons , but i find it tedious here now i 've already answered this but i 'll gladly do it again killing a grown kid is murder ! why did society make a law to try and stop murders \? because society benefits from having its productive members alive and contributing ! now at the end of the day , morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species do n't believe me \? thou shall not kill thou shall not steal thou shall honour thy parents etc all designed to foster a peaceful productive society with the end goal being survival of the human species now , a kid has made it all the way through the whole process of fetal development , which is not easy to do because miscarriage statistics are quite high that kid has earned its right to be a part of society killing that kid is wrong a fetus on the other hand , can be created very easily and can also be lost just as easily too the point here however is that the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct , so society has n't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership this is the way it should be maybe one day , we 'll find ourselves in the position of an endangered species and guess what \? i bet there 'll be a law in every country that abortion is illegal ! that 's why societies make law if it has nothing to do with the survival of society , society should stay out of it",-1,+1,0

it would be just oh wellill have another kid the mother has rightsshe had a right to have sex she had a right to take the risk but once a life has started those rights should be put on the back burner until the child is bornthen she also has rights to decide what to do with it keep it or adopt it out its nine short monthsto do what is rightto allow something to livethat you helped create after conception it is a separate human beingthis is a scientific fact a fact you propose to kill human beingsyou say this is ok how barbaric and cold is that \? it should not matter whether the child will make it or not if it does n't and diesthen it was meant to be abortion is premeditated killing nothing spontaneous about it you hire someone to kill someonein this case the unborn child in the womb who was invited in by the mother , but her risk her choice i gee the oprah example to show thatthe argument by pro aborts does not hold water most pro aborts say abortion is good becausethe child might have problemsmight grow up in povertymight face lives trials i got news for yawe all face trials oprah did in her lifeand she overcame them she grew up in a home that was not healthy or functional to kill because you think someone might face a similar lifeis still wrong so do n't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life so full of misery that they would be better off dead you said this again , not necessarily i support abortion only when a foetus ca n't be confidently said to lack rationality , autonomy and self consciousness now wait one minute here can a newborn baby do any of these \? no what does a newborn have that it did n't have five minutes before in the womb before it was born \? lol are you telling me that you want abortion legal because the woman has a right to her own bodyand then you tell her she cant abort in later months \? lol","you obviously feel killing is ok , i do not i have never made this claim you are putting words in my mouth you do n't think two wrongs make a right in this circumstance because you champion abortion that is because i do n't think abortion is wrong in every circumstance i think some people have the wrong motivations to abort a baby and or under the wrong medical circumstances , making some abortion cases morally wrong i give it personhood but the idea of personhood is something that you have not defined clearly if you want to argue on the basis of personhood , then a baby within the first trimester does n't even have a brain to speak of it , therefore , does n't have the ability to feel , let alone reason , within the first trimester war is about protection how can the unborn fight for its protection \? you are comparing the two wrongly war is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself even if i were to accept that the unborn baby is a person \( which is a view that i do not necessarily agree with , as i 've explained above \) , then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life threatening illness ! well obviously you do n't think life is sacredyour pro abortion lol i'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour that just goes to show how frivolous you are what a hypocrite and , by the way , i do n't think human life is sacred and i do n't believe in the sanctity of human life if you think that life is sacred , then you , by logical deduction , should not be able to eat anything that has life \( i e animals and even vegetables and fruits \) its nine short monthsto do what is rightto allow something to live you are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through during the nine short months furthermore , you said allow something to live , right \? if the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother , then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the mother to live if you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby , are you doing what is right \? after conception it is a separate human being it is not as i have explained , the baby is not a human being within the first trimester furthermore , the unborn baby , no matter at any stage , is dependent on it 's mother completely for nutrition in other words , the baby is , technically speaking , a parasite the oxford english dictionary defines a parasite as biol an animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism \( technically called its host \) and draws its nutriment directly from it also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others , but not at their expense \( strictly called commensal or symbiotic \) also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance , as the cuckoo , the skua gull , etc thus , by definition , the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body at the expense of her own health how barbaric and cold is that \? which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not or whether it should be legal or not this is simply an appeal to emotion it should not matter whether the child will make it or not then , whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you pro choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision they do not promote abortion , simply the legalisation of abortion if you ca n't see the difference , then you 're an idiot abortion is premeditated killing and so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live if the mother 's life is threatened by the pregnancy , by not aborting the child , you are also premeditating the killing of the mother thus , by your standards , you face a paradox i am appalled by how people can call themselves pro life when they say that the mother 's life does n't matter as long as the baby is not aborted this is hypocrisy of the greatest degree most pro aborts say abortion is good becausethe child might have problemsmight grow up in povertymight face lives trials i am not a pro abort i am pro choice , as i have explained the difference so do n't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life so full of misery that they would be better off dead you are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery thus , you are attacking a straw man poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been allowed to survive face you said this again , not necessarily i support abortion only when a foetus ca n't be confidently said to lack rationality , autonomy and self consciousness now wait one minute here can a newborn baby do any of these \? no of course it does it has autonomy and self consciousness but then again , even if i agree with you , by saying that a newborn baby ca n't have such experiences , it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral thus , your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand are you telling me that you want abortion legal because the woman has a right to her own body the short answer is yes , but the long answer is no congratulations , you have proven that you at least have some level of intelligence",-1,+1,0

to most people it is an argument that is easiest to comprehend , and it should appeal to their prejudices you want to win points with me \? argue in a way that is clear , has few red herrings , and is rational rather than an appeal to feelings","really \? so why if a mentally retarded person or a person with alheizmer 's attacks me then the state does not criminally prosecute me and also they are not responsible for any criminal or civil damage \? again my response to you is whe na person is wounded or hurt by another person which invovles the damage of cells , tissues , blood cells and or organs , does that not make them reliable for a criminal charge against them \? does that not mean that in these very cells are proof of life \? why does the jury and court of law requires pictures of the wounds and a complete medical examination then \? you seem to be lacking the understanding of these topics again , abortion is the killing of the fetus in a woman 's body but prostitution is the selling of a woman 's body over which she has total control so to make it simple both has to do with whether a woman has a right to choose or control what she does with her own body why then are there laws preventing her from selling her body when according to you women should have everyright to choose what they do because it is their topic the last guy i asked that question gave me the same response you did in a debate and it resulted in points being deducted from his team because if you look deeper into these two subjects both have the same context or idea about a woman 's right to control her own body if the records of abortion that are done publicly and the expenses are endured by the government then does't that make it taxpayers money \? do n't taxpayers have a right to see where their money is going \? again you are making it seem as if the names of these persons will be made public and you are forgetting that we are talking about statisitics and not individuality check up on the deaths caused by abortion and you will see that we are talking about thousands and not hundreds so then do mean that these lives have no value when it comes to terminating abortion read up on some women who did abortion but regrets it deeply now and also do n't forget that abortion can cause future infertility why is it not important to the topic when it is related to the topic \? is n't part of our argument based on whether it will make women more responsible or not \? last time i asked that question , the opposing team again was forced to produce that facts before me because that fact backs up the point i am trying to make that abortion does not makes people more responsible almost half of all abortion cases \( 48 \) according to the center for disease control are repeat abortions it does not matter whether or not you are steps ahead of me or not because my arguments are strong and backed up by facts whereas you are giving opinions so what you are saying does not and will not have any effect on me because i have won this debate two to three times face to face because of my facts and the strength of my arguments my opposing team lost because they were giving opinions and had no evidence to support their claims debating is all about critical thinking and you are percieving me as being off topic but then you yourself do n't understand some of the questions i am asking you so how can you say i am off topic \? i might be a teenager but i am releasing my first book soon , i am a student in pre law and i have held several positions in my country of origing including a personal assistant to the supervising police superintendent of juvenile affars , legal clerk for the attorney general in my country and also assistant sworn clerk of the supreme court of my country now i am pursuing my studies in criminal law again you need to understand that debating invloves critical thinking not just easy to understand as you make it seem maybe on this website but not in reality and because i am a teenager does not mean that i do n't understand what society is because there are many adults that would never be able to accomplish what i have done",+1,-1,0

abortion,"i find the fact that there are instances where women think that it is right to abort the birth of a child is incredibly outrageous ! to think that people would rather cut of life in its entirety than to take wiser options , such as setting their child up for an adoption , or even personally entrusting the baby to someone close to them if i could 'personally' define the word 'abortion , ' then it would be as follows 'abortion the term refers to the irrational decision to kill the child before it has been birthed from the womb' i am not going to sugar coat abortions , because it 's true , they are nothing short of murder ! 'the children are killed before they can even process the thought' is one term that i have seen a few times in this debate \( of course they have been worded differently , but again , i am not here to sugar coat this sort of thing \) , and i can say that the mother father has stolen the right and privilege of thought from these children by killing them they have also denied them of love , care , protection and most of all , they have denied them of a life as i have stated previously , i cannot even begin to understand why so many pregnant women do not consider putting the child up for an adoption rather than simply cutting the child off completely ! surely the majority of you all would agree with me that a child has its rights even if it cannot understand them ! but the second that an abortion begins , you have stripped that child of it 's rights , and there is no way that you can ever make amends and no , i am not trying to send anyone on a guilt trip , but i would be glad to know that some of you have come to realize what exactly an abortion does , and not just to think of the process as stabbing someone in the vagina",putting more children up for adoption when there are already hundreds of thousands of children waiting to be adopted is ridiculous if you really think about it most of these children are put into foster care where they spend part of their lives with 6 or 7 other kids being miserable because they are being moved around 15 or 16 times in a year we have all heard about how traumatizing foster care can be for a lot of children who end up having a lot of mental issues and distress when they are older yeah you may be keeping a child a live but when you think about what they have to go through as children in the system is it really worth it \? and not to mention if they do get adopted young and find out when they are older it is going to be extremely hard for them when people get abortions the baby cant process it or know ! ! what is the baby going to miss or know if they are never born nothing its not like they are going to be born to another family and say oh yeah i had a mother once but she got rid of me before i was born,-1,+1,0

abortion,"no , you are way out in left field stop the red herrings and keep it to the topic what does hitler have to do with abortions \? as i said earlier , one of two commandments to adhere to as a christian \( that jesus said himself in the gospels \) is to love your neighbor as yourself let me ask you , what did jesus believe about abortions , since you feel that my interpretation is not right \? what is the view of right and wrong according to jesus of nazareth \? you stand by and watch people kill each other during war what kind of love is this \? yes , you can do something concerning abortions judging them as a murderer however does not encompass this that is the main point of my argument i am saying you cannot judge someone to be murderer and that they are automatically going to hell because they have an abortion what do you mean by 'judging what i wrote' \? judging to me is calling a male gay because he wears pink , calling a person retarded because they fail a grade in school , and calling a person hell bound who has an abortion apparently you did not read the last part of my statement concerning sin also , i need to know what your definition of judging is , since you disagree with mine","you are correct in your assessment of me doctrinally i consider myself a reformed baptist , but primarily a follower of the historical jesus of nazareth i also think we agree for the most part , however i took exception with several things you said because i found them to be inconsistent with a christian world view primarily your statement that christian morality applies solely to christians that is known as moral relativism \( for a full discussion of this please see the book by francis j beckwith and greg koukl titled relativism feet firmly planted in mid air \) the scripture i quoted was to make the point that morality , according to jesus , was objective i was very explicit about that to infer anything beyond that is to read into what i said something that is not there i also took and take exception to your insistence that we are commanded not to judge the only thing i can find is a command not to judge hypocritically and then a command to judge once we have dealt with our own sin i do agree with your sentiment of judgmentalism and the holier than thou attitude i think your are trying to address if we are saved by grace alone , through faith alone , in christ alone then we have nothing in which to boast even the faith i have is a gift from god ephesians 2 8 i am by nature a murderer and hell bound sinner and deserving of the wrath of god , but i have received mercy and i 'm now commanded to go and show mercy as i have been shown mercy but i ask how are we to fulfill the great commission if we first do n't judge that people are murderers \( see the sermon on the mount \) and hell bound \? if there is no peril , there is no need of a savior and no need to warn people and that means that jesus died in vain but jesus made a judgment , people are murderers and hell bound and it matters not how they got there , only that they need to be saved and he asked me to go for him and seek and save that which is lost if i'm his follower than i 'll do what he commands me if you love me , keep my commandments john 14 15 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit , teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you and lo , i am with you always , even to the end of the age amen matthew 28 19 20",-1,-1,1

abortion,"no my dear you do not obviously know the law our government says the child belongs to her , that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy without any confirmation from him he does not even have to know , even if he is the father if he was recognized as a player the law would not be what it is today nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either that is the law the fact is , the baby is hers at conception she took the risk the sperm leaves his body and enters her his part is done the sperm was a gift , he certainly cant ask for it back can he \? lol she holds the cards and has him by the you know what that is if he wants the baby , because whether he wants it or not its not an issue of course i am a christian and do n't believe it should be this way , but that is the law today i believe personally that the man should be considered that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion like i said today she can kill and he need not even know it i talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs you said its unfair why \? you are trying to make yourself feel better look better you are pro choice and believe the option should be there remember consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing you said , it 's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful christian you are ! why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore the man is just as responsible for pregnancy he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant your opinion is sexist is so many levels am i calling names \? didnt you call me a pig \? better reread that section am i insulting you because you are pro abortion \? well gee i am sorry , the truth hurts you said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonthat abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it now if the way i described it sounds crasssorry , but i was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made most abortions happen on unwed women women mainly who profess to be christian in fact that does not change the fact how they got pregnant why dont you describe it for us in more politically correct terms \? it still wont change the truth of how it happened as i said again the man is an onlooker so says the law that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in is that better way to put it \? you are absolutely unbelievable you want to blameand blame you do , for what is a womans issue , so says the law what do you not get \? dont you have the guts to call it like it is \? if the man is accountable wouldnt he have a decision in the pregnancy \? no the government says no he is not an issue and he is not responsible as for condemning anyone for an abortionthis discussion is not about that i work with women who have had abortions because i know what its like , i had one i was one of those women who spread her legs it was my call , my responsibility and the pain and agony i suffered was on me as it should be so dont tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through the work i do is in this field , i see the pain , especially afterwards and guess what the pain is just not experienced by the woman , but by the boyfriends , the husbands the children the woman calls the shots as i did when i had mine some thirty years ago i would give anything to be able to take that day backand i know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way you are pro choice whether you want to believe it or notbecause you simply condone others the right to kill were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into hitlers ovens pro life \? how about those people that owned slaves \? would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one \? and do you have to use the f bomb in order to debate \? is it an effective way to get your point across \? of course you will retaliateyou condone abortion which is violence you ranted onyou are a vile , horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this how dare you say i contribute to abortion if a woman asked me if she should have an abortion i 'd say 'it 's up to you , it 's your choice' i would n't judge her , i would n't influence her opinion if someone is considering an abortion than they are n't anti abortion anyway and pro abortionists existing wo n't mean diddly squat to their decision i was making an analogy that you simply did not like well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute \? how about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull \? if someone drives someone to a robbery and they are caught does the police just say ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye \? i mean come on if you refused to take her to the abortion , she might not get it if the doctor didnt show up , the nurse refuse to do itthe baby might have a chance you said , yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion , hence i think it 's okay before then pain has everything to do with it , if death was n't painful people would n't be so scared of it i do n't have to be entirely pro abortion just like i would n't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance i would like if my daughter was starving i 'd steal food for her without a second thought again thanks for the insult , what a wonderful christian you are you can act self righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people , demeaning them and being downright rude not to mention you lie very godly youre so ridiculous its not even funny bolongamany people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it not just because of pain insult \? retaliation , isnt that what its all about , you said so yourself didnt you \? then you judge me when you think i retaliate why are you judging me from different standards than you live by \? lol oh yes because i am a christian , right am i supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup , not stand up for the things that are unchristian \? no case for abortion can be made scripturally christ would want me to stand up the his little children , he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin , devastated my life until i came to him so you dont like how i put things christ said , they hated me first and will hate you as well i am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth you might be the greatest person in the world , but you are pro abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice you are not for and against you are for because you think it should be legal you said , is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it 's money \? you 're wrong , having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing , his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is if you 're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you 're obviously very wrong i said , if a woman and man are marriedhe cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion he has no rights even though it is his child but he would be held legally responsible for child support if he did not want the child and wanted her to get an abortion she calls the shots now if they were not married , she cant hold him financially accountable for anything the baby is hers , unless she puts his name on the birth certificateand in that case he might for forced to pay you said , what \? a date i randomly made up \? no the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands and the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science , i linked you the information but it 's clear you obviously do n't read half of what people try to say to you which is where i get my opinion on when i think abortion is okay well you are wrong again http en wikipedia org wiki james elgin gill 128 days early or 21 weeks 5 days early then there was amillia taylor who is also often cited as the most premature baby she was born on 24 october 2006 in miami , florida , at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation at birth she was 9 inches \( 23 cm \) long and weighed 10 ounces \( 283 grams \) she suffered digestive and respiratory problems , together with a brain hemorrhage she was discharged from the baptist children 's hospital on 20 february 2007 there are babies like this all over the world being born my niece was born 23 weeks 4 days she spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old she weighed just over 1 pound i know the information out thereyou need to get educated and read a bit more , instead of just google and posting pain is not an issue personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all if i had no worth for the womb why would i have a child \? you value your own child and do n't care about another in the womb \? \? \? \? \? yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks , right \?","no my dear you do not obviously know the law our government says the child belongs to her , that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy without any confirmation from him when did i say that was n't the law do you read anything i type \? the fact is , the baby is hers at conception she took the risk tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child can a woman conceive on her own \? can a man produce a child on his own \? no both sexes are required to conceive a baby , they are both responsible for the act of conception the sperm was a gift , he certainly cant ask for it back can he \? what \? answer this question please does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman \? does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant \? does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort \? yes he knows all of these things and yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman therefore he is half responsible he is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman i believe personally that the man should be considered if the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have seeing as you 're anti abortion would n't that bother you \? like i said today she can kill and he need not even know it i talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs well if they talk about it they obviously know about it you said its unfair why \? i said what 's unfair \? am i calling names \? here 's a list ! directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me is this what the word of jesus taught you do \? name call \? materialist judge mental you look silly your ignorant you are cold you champion killing sissy hitler , margaret sanger your views on this mirror theirs you are a joke youre so ridiculous its not even funny you respresent death to innocent human beings didnt you call me a pig \? better reread that section you deserved to be called a pig i hate sexism i 'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic , being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me oh and perhaps you re read that section because here is what i said i never denied that i called you a name hypocrite all you 've done since this debate began is name call , i will retaliate i'm not the one in denial i called you a pig once you 've demeaned and name called multiple times you said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonthat abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it i know and your point is \? most abortions happen on unwed women women mainly who profess to be christian in fact that does not change the fact how they got pregnant why dont you describe it for us in more politically correct terms \? it still wont change the truth of how it happened what on earth are you on about \? i 've had sex i know what sex entails , i know how a child is conceived you said this it got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her she is the one taking the risk not the man this is sexist , you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant of course he does could a woman get pregnant without a man \? no therefore the man has to assume half the responsibility for a child being conceived there are two things that create a life , an egg and a sperm half and half they both decide to have sex , they both know the risks , they both procreate they are both responsible as i said again the man is an onlooker so says the law that is if he is not married an unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law for someone who claims that i know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself girl who is allowing him in the man also allows himself in stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex if the man did n't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape if he did n't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom just as the girl could say no or use a condom they both take equal blame dont you have the guts to call it like it is \? if the man is accountable wouldnt he have a decision in the pregnancy \? how , explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy \? that is how it is i'm afraid it takes a man and a woman to procreate they both did it he does n't have a decision in pregnancy by law because oh god do i have to repeat myself again because if he chose for her to abort when she did n't want to he would be forcing her it 's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months and if you read what i say most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement as for condemning anyone for an abortionthis discussion is not about that seriously \? all you 've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion because i know what its like , i had one i'm sorry about the fact you had one but it does n't mean i ca n't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite how dare you tell me i contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when i 've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you 've had one i was one of those women who spread her legs it was my call , my responsibility and the pain and agony i suffered was on me as it should be in a sense i'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you and i actually feel very sorry for you someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something the person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible it takes two people to make a child you cannot create a life on your own so dont tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through again stop lying about things i 've said i never said i did , in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of americans have that i hate telling someone 'i know how you feel' i see the pain , especially afterwards i have friends and family who have had abortions i would never claim to know how they felt , they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught it 's abortion i never said it was happy fairy la la land however they could have felt worse if they had a child what about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable , unable to love the child \? do their emotions mean nothing \? but by the boyfriends , the husbands the children i'm not denying it is n't an upsetting process , stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when i have n't even spoken a word about this who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling \? how selfish i would give anything to be able to take that day backand i know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way i'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too you are pro choice whether you want to believe it or notbecause you simply condone others the right to kill not pro choice thanks i have a limit that 's like saying 'you 're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it 's within the speed limit ! ' it makes no sense were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into hitlers ovens pro life \? what has the holocaust got to do with abortion since they felt pain and were living , viable humans this has no relation to my opinion how about those people that owned slaves \? would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one \? again what does having a slave have to do with abortion of course i would n't and i would n't condone it but you 're just talking about meaningless jargon now and do you have to use the f bomb in order to debate \? is it an effective way to get your point across \? i sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer of course you will retaliateyou condone abortion which is violence i do n't think calling someone a pig is violent , how did you come to that conclusion \? youre so ridiculous its not even funny bolongamany people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it not just because of pain i did n't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death stop lying i'm not scared of what 's beyond it , i do n't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense and if it was true , which i do n't believe it is , everyone i love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of god , i 'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you i was making an analogy that you simply did not like well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute \? how about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull \? you accused me of having the same views as a nazi , you accused me of being a racist murderer and now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are nazi 's \?

abortion,"i 'd like to take the time to address several tings that have been raised in this debate and clarify my argument against abortion first , the affect this debate has on women who have had abortions this reality has weighed heavily on my conscience but i think a greater issue is at stake here and therefore the cost is worth it the greater good that is being served here is the hope that abortion on demand might someday be ended and that the emotional trauma it causes to women will be ended also the holocaust of abortion will not be ended until people see and know the reality of what it is it has been stunning to see through the course of this debate the lengths people will go to so as to sugar coat this issue and make it appear not so bad and actually justifiable so my effort is to make that know as best i can but the truth is that when women , who have had abortions , come to a correct understanding of what has happened there is real pain and real quilt and that certainly is not to be dismissed so for those who have had abortions i say there is a way out of the pain and quilt true forgiveness is possible there is only one way out and that is through the great exchange god in christ takes your life and he gives you his when he died , you died and the charges against you are paid in full , the debt is canceled then the life of perfection he lived becomes yours it is laid to your account so you go from an infinity negative debt to an infinity positive righteousness and through his resurrection you are raised to newness of life this is only possible through repentance and faith confess your sins and trust god to do for you what he said he would in christ this faith is not a leap in the dark , like crossing your fingers it is an active trust , like standing on solid ground a confident expectation in the faithfulness of god with that said i would like to clarify my argument against abortion further and answer the question should abortion be banned but let me preface my argument with a disclaimer i realize there is a difference between proof and persuasion there is no argument that i can put forth that ca n't be disputed there are actually people who will argue for the reality of square circles so i put this argument forth for those who are truly open minded in hopes you will be persuaded the taking of the life of an innocent human being without proper justification is murder and murder is illegal abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification therefore it is murder and should be illegal","quoting god is not how you 're going to win arguments i actually respect what you believe , but i ask that you also respect what i believe i believe that women should have the choice",-1,+1,0

why \? it 's because you 've written it already in a different post ! recycling is acceptable when it comes to milk cartons , but i find it tedious here now i 've already answered this but i 'll gladly do it again killing a grown kid is murder ! why did society make a law to try and stop murders \? because society benefits from having its productive members alive and contributing ! now at the end of the day , morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species do n't believe me \? thou shall not kill thou shall not steal thou shall honour thy parents etc all designed to foster a peaceful productive society with the end goal being survival of the human species now , a kid has made it all the way through the whole process of fetal development , which is not easy to do because miscarriage statistics are quite high that kid has earned its right to be a part of society killing that kid is wrong a fetus on the other hand , can be created very easily and can also be lost just as easily too the point here however is that the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct , so society has n't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership this is the way it should be maybe one day , we 'll find ourselves in the position of an endangered species and guess what \? i bet there 'll be a law in every country that abortion is illegal ! that 's why societies make law if it has nothing to do with the survival of society , society should stay out of it","about ad hominem , let 's say all the nasty things about me are true and much worse what does that tell us about my claim \? nothing it only says something about me and is therefore irrelevant to the question at hand so what if i'm logically unsound and have obvious character weaknesses \? does that mean i'm therefore incapable of saying anything truthful \? even a broken clock is right twice a day so to say because of this therefore that i think is a a non sequitur and since recycling is a good thing i 'll say it again insult is not an argument , it 's a failure to provide one now your free to use them if you like but they dont carry much weight with me i really am much worse than you think now at the end of the day , morals and righteousness are all about survival of the species if that is true , then you are mistaken when you said killing a grown kid is murder because that means at some point it would become a good thing to kill grown kids when it is necessary for the survival of the species or to foster a peaceful productive society but who decides what is good for the species , how do you define good , good for who \? but to my question can i kill it your answer tells me that you instinctively know that there is something inherently wrong with murder and that it ought not be done you recognize that there is something about murder that makes it wrong and that wrongness is a characteristic of the act and not the peoples opinion of it gassing six million jews was wrong even if the germans thought it was good you know that and so do i but if that is the case then your premise of morals and righteousness being about survival of the species would be false because the wrongness of the act proceeds our perception of it and is independent of us it is objectively wrong and further more how did it come to be that survival of the species was the good to be obtained \? because in your scheme it could have been otherwise in your scheme it would appear to be that there really is no such thing as the good or the wrong because if your correct , like ive said , we could have just as well decided that killing grown kids is a good thing but when we see kids butchered or any other injustice in the world something cries out within us that what we see is wrong and we know its wrong because we know there is a good from which it deviates and your definition of that good \( survival of the human species \) is woefully inadequate to account for that kind of reaction because if you were to see someone gunned downed i seriously do n't think you are saying to yourself hey , we as a society need that person you therefore should n't do that no i think not , your gut reaction is whoa ! that 's not right what the we do n't make laws to make things wrong , we make laws because we know that somethings are inherently wrong , they are wrong in and of themselves , like murder , theft and disrespecting people especially our elders but what i think is more telling is the way you discriminate on the basis of level of development notice how you use the phrase grown kid so i ask you whats the difference between a human in the womb and a human at the park \? level of development the terms fetus and grown child describe the stages of development in the life of a human in this case so when the life of a human is unjustly taken be it at 1 month after conception , 1 month after birth or 10 years of age it is wrong , thats called moral clarity thats why the question can i kill it is so clarifying its the last word , it , that makes all the difference what is it , is an ontological question im not asking the question , whats its stage of development that would be absurd to answer the question that way you would never answer your kid that way hey daddy , can i kill it \? well son , how old is it , you know the younger the better but thats how you try and answer the question of abortion i keep asking , what is it that we are killing \? and you keep telling me how old it is , well its just at the fetus stage ok , so what is it \? and like ive said before a question not properly answered doesnt go away , it keeps getting asked so i will keep asking the question , what is it \? till i get an adequate answer but honestly you know as well as i do what it is and the only reason you would answer differently is if you were trying to justify something that you instinctively know to be wrong final thought on showing everyone that your opposition is incapable of making sound judgments you said the human species is in no danger whatsoever of being extinct , so society has n't seen fit to mandate saving every chance of adding to its membership this statement from you destroys your whole argument if this is true , why are there still laws against murder \? and why are there hospitals \? why did the president just pass a massive health care reform bill \? if we are in no danger whatsoever of being extinct what are we so concerned about \? if our survival is not in question then what is the basis for our actions \? it ca n't be survival of the human species , were doing that quite well so what then is it if it 's not survival of the human species \? maybe somethings are actually objectively wrong , maybe human life is valuable and maybe we know it",+1,-1,0

after conception it is a separate human being it is not as i have explained , the baby is not a human being within the first trimester furthermore , the unborn baby , no matter at any stage , is dependent on it 's mother completely for nutrition in other words , the baby is , technically speaking , a parasite the oxford english dictionary defines a parasite as biol an animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism \( technically called its host \) and draws its nutriment directly from it also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others , but not at their expense \( strictly called commensal or symbiotic \) also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance , as the cuckoo , the skua gull , etc thus , by definition , the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body at the expense of her own health how barbaric and cold is that \?

and my argument of choice falls apart in cases of rape , thus , it is my only other exception that was not my point an immature brain is not a defective one what i said was that i will not stop any mother and or father from deciding to abort their unborn if they do so within the first trimester because the brain of the fetus has n't even been formed yet hence my point that it all distills down to a meaningless argument",+1,-1,0

\) should have to ride out the course of the consequence treatment is a way of dealing with and std so is leaving it untreated by the same principles on which you find abortion unacceptable \( not the human rights issue , which is i am not considering in this comparison , but the argument that the only way to correctly deal with the consequences of sex is to not get an abortion \) then you should also advocate that people not seek treatment for stds doing so would be the easy way out , after all i do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if i were to have done that , i would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother 's health risks during the pregnancy and it 's grave importance you think abortion is acceptable only some of the time in cases where the mother is not in danger , but does not want the fetus , do you think she should be made to keep it \? if so , this is reducing her to the rank of a subcitizen whose body is mercy to the actions others find acceptable or unacceptable as i said before , if you personally think she should keep the baby but do not advocate making abortion illegal in any situation , then i do not actually have anything to dispute and secondly , i do not see why you have labelled a mother for incubating a fetus she does n't want for if she does n't want the fetus , she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place have gotten pregnant in the first place would she \?

jeez , i do n't know what i'm more disappointed in your poor grammar or the fact that i understood that perfectly a person 's profession has nothing to do with their ability to control themselves unless she 's being raped for money , then shes exercising self control by being a prostitute what are the amount of women that undergoes repeat abortions \?

abortion,"so are you saying that murder is not cruelty \? according to the laws it is and also a person can commit rape in a cruel manner by hurting the victim mentally and physically through the ordeal like i asked aveske , a person who is paralyzed has lost their consciousness , so should we kill them because they cannot think or feel too \?","it is not what you care about what you think or care about is different from the view of the laws i hope you remember this very quote in a few minutes , when i point out again that abortion is not considered homicide because the law does not recognize a fetus as a human being , therefor does not extend the same protections to it the fact that you think abortion is murder has no influence on whether or not the law considers abortion to be murder as i said , the parasitism issue will no longer be addressed because you continue to ignore very basic evidence and qualified unbiased sources , in favor of presenting me with a page from a pro life website you seem to be forgetting that the fetus not only has a human identity but a separate human identity which identifies the fetus as another human being when the fetus is inside the mother , it is inseparable from her system , and its lack of a fully formed or functioning brain prevents it from developing or retaining an identity the only difference between an actual baby and the fetus is one is outside the womb and the other isnt so why is it foolish \? organs are a part of the human body but can organs develop into a human being \? that is so far from the only difference between a fetus and a six month old baby in the fetus , the brain does not even possess all its parts that is where the organ comparison comes in it has absolutely nothing to do with their potential it has to do with capacity for awareness in this case , the organ and the fetus have equal capacity for awareness none six month old babies are capable of feeling pain , reacting voluntarily to external stimuli , and their consciousness is not contested in any form i actually think it is kind of monstrous to suggest abortion is in any way comparable to killing an infant , implying that women who get abortions are exactly the same as people who beat their infants to death note that when i use fetus , i am not referring to all fetuses but to fetuses before the stage of viability , well before the thalamus is formed or functioning a fetus beyond the point of viability is another matter , i think , as the interests of both the fetus and the mother could be preserved through an early delivery or c section what do you mean the homicide laws do not apply to fetuses in america \? last time i had a conversation with a judge he told me that the double counts of homicide still applies to all fetuses and it is still in practice so where are you living in \? in fantasy america \? 1 i already said i do not agree with this precedent and i think it is contradictory , again , unless the fetus is past the point of viability 2 people who perform and receive abortions are not charged with homicide how could this be true if fetuses were protected under homicide legislation \? it seems that you are having a tough time understanding the message i am trying to convey according to scientists one of the rules for life and not living to exist in a individual , the first rule that should be present is that the individual or entity must be able to be distinguished from the dead if this rule exists , then the entity or individual can be referred to as having life at no point did i contest any of the things you just mentioned why is this the third time you have repeated this \? i have never said i think fetuses should be classify as dead i have said numerous times i know they are alive the fact that something is biologically classified as living is not what makes it a human life where is the disconnect \? what do you not understand about this \? i am frustrated with your apparent refusal to understand simple statements , but please understand i am not asking the following question with the intent of being insulting or belittling we are clearly having a problem understanding each other is english your first language \? if a person has the intention to abort the child so engages in an action that will knowingly cause a miscarriage , then that no longer counts as spontaneous abortion but rather induced abortion for an action to be determined whether it is criminal or not , there has to be intention to commit the action itself in order for one to determine whether a miscarriage was induced or spontaneous , they would have to investigate therefor , if a fetus was given the same rights as every other human , then every miscarriage would lead to an automatic investigation because every miscarriage could potentially be a murder if it had been determined that the mother engaged in any activity that led to the miscarriage , even through negligence , she would be treated as though she contributed to the death of a human being , with all the legal punishment this entails",-1,+1,0
abortion,"why not \? if you have an opinion on something , do you intend for it only to apply to you \? or to everyone \? if you think smoking is morally wrong , do you think it is wrong for you or for everyone if you think killing is morally wrong , do you think it is wrong for only you to do \? or for anyone to do \? no , of course each person has his own opinion , but most of people judge other people a lot of people who are against abortion really judge those who are for abortion but everybody has to have own opinion i have mine , as well as you have yours are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception \? or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species \( ie sex \) \? hey , there are a lot of teenagers who become pregnant i wrote it just as an example , because i know one girl who was in that situation consider birth control before i had sex now that it is too late , i would accept responsibility for my actions , or inaction as the case may be well , you would , but there are a lot of people who wouldnt accept responsibility as i said , i know someone who was in that situation , and it was really hard for her to make a choice having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire and you probably wont ever forget about that either , in fact , youll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control yes it is a good option , but it is very hard to give the baby up for adoption , when you gave a birth to him , when this little baby had been under your heart for 9 months also there could be any reasons why woman cannot be pregnant for this period it is not so easy to be pregnant alone \( if we are talking about that bad situation \) yes , people should think before having sex , but everybody makes mistakes and everybody solves their problems as they can somebody is strong enough to take a responsibility for the baby , but somebody cannot it is their choice \) murder is unlawful killing , abortion is legal therefore not unlawful , nor murder you confused me \) \) i didnt get you i didnt mean lawful , or unlawful i meant that by abortion people kill their babies i dont think that its a right maybe a privilege a privilege \? dont know i think that a privilege is something that is given to someone after doing something good everybody can be wrong do you agree with that \? we cannot live without mistakes it teaches us how to be better , by making mistakes we can understand what is right and what is wrong , or something like that what about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes \? i agree that once a mistake is made , that one should fix it , but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion i agree with you , that we should take the responsibility in preventing mistakes but there could be different situations , when people cannot control them somebody are not wise enough , somebody doesnt think before doing something but life is intended for us to self perfection it is a life we learn from the mistakes of a lifetime somebody has to do his own mistakes to understand something , somebody can understand from the mistakes of others people are different that is why our life is very interesting \) so first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime \? where do we draw the line \? in our society it wouldnt be understandable if the offenders of homicide wouldnt be punished of course they should be punished but in my opinion they should be punished only be god but our society wouldnt accept it , and i understand why we are living in the world where some people should be punished like going to jail or something like that , because it is a good way for other people to live quietly so that offenders also can fix their mistakes after a jail , for example they are also people they just make more serious mistakes like murder , or something well no , not technically murder it is killing , but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity \? doing so may help you sleep at night , but does it really fixit \? i think it is in any case , it would be better then doing nothing , right \? the most important thing when you understand you mistakes of course , a person cannot give a life for exactly that person he killed \) it is impossible physically , but giving a life for somebody else is an answer too i think have you seen the film seven pounds with will smith \? this film describes what i am talking about very good he killed 7 people , and it was his mistake but after that he helped 7 other people i understood that abortion is not so bad after watching it if a person steals , wouldnt it be fixing it to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from \? yes , in my opinion , it is a best solution , but if for example the person from whom you stole is dead for example , you cannot give the money back to him in that case , you can give them to somebody who needs it may be for charity \? \) one does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isnt able to be a good parent yes , it is a good option , of course but there are several options to take responsibility for child and to bring him up yourself , to give him to an adoption agency , or to have an abortion \( there can be some other options , i dont know \) but each person should choose himself and to take responsibility for his actions and decisions if people took more responsibility , then abortion would be less of an issue in the world a agree with you but there are a lot of people who cannot take responsibility even for themselves , that is why we have a lot of options of course , i wouldnt have an abortion , because i love children and i want them , but i do not exclude it if i would in a situation i described earlier , i would do it but in other cases i wouldnt but abortion is not wrong abortion is an option option which is judged by someone , which is supported by someone , which is not understandable by someone , but a lot of women do it and they will do it in spite of other peoples opinions and that is their choice",no abortion is wrong it 's as simple as that it is an option but an evil one however that being said i do think that having laws against it really does n't make sense people ought to have the choice that does not however on any terms make it right,+1,-1,0

abortion,"that is not my reasoning i do not believe that you were trying to argue that wasting sperm is the same as wasting life , however i was taking your argument about potential life to its absurd logical conclusion i have some tests coming up so i wo n't respond immediately perhaps this weekend i 'll write something up summarizing my position i look forward to reading it my responses have been criticisms of the argument from sapience you have been making , not a argument for or against abortion themselves i made note of this , however i hope you realise , along with those making the argument , that it is an inherently grey issue","ok , this is my criticism of the argument for abortion from sapience the argument for abortion from sapience is a valid logical argument known as barbra \( or if your picky you can called it a variation of that argument \) and is as follows 1 all non \( human persons \) are beings which do not have rights 2 all fetuses are non \( human persons \) 3 therefore all fetuses are beings which do not have rights this is indeed barbara \( and a disjunctive syllogism \) 1 all a are b 2 all c are a 3 all c are b the soundness of this argument is completely dependent on the category of non \( human persons \) which is dependent on the category of person this category is ill defined to start with but there are a few things that seems to be commonly agreed on 1 a human person is a human being 2 a human person is a human being with the quality of personhood this forces us to look into personhood , so lets look into it 1 personhood is dependent on the brain , a how developed of a brain \? i how is this decision decided or development measured \? likely by what functions the brain can accomplish , then the importance of those functions would have to be supported ii if the functions of the brain is what decides how developed of a brain then there is two options of approach which are as follows aa the brain needs to demonstrate these functions a lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated , and some will be timed based for even adults thus personhood , and rights become transient rights disappear before death , and depending on what functions also disappear daily rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death bb the brain needs to be capable of these functions arguably this is the same criteria as 1 ii aa since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it capability has two meanings the statistical probability of something happening being high , which is the same as hypothetical ability or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen , also hypothetical \( bad definition i know , but it should be clear and also a important input is time \) what is this something with variable inputs \? is it a brain , the process of brain development , both \? why one over the other options \? in less cases but in some the brains capability of some brain functions changes in the same way as the ability to demonstrate brain functions do most brain functions change with time if we base rights on most brain functions then the existence of any rights at all would be much much more volatile them they actually are keeping all that in mind it seems clear that a human being also being a human person from birth to death is hypothetical , that human beings stop and start being human persons at times and still retain their rights also human beings which lack basic brain functions , such as babies \( object permanence , for example which many animals possess \) , possess rights thus the argument from sapience is unsound premise one is not true the truth value of premise two depends on the definition of personhood the definition of personhood is arbitrary for it depends on a arbitrary selection of brain functions which are themselves usually ill defined and heavily dependent on subjective interpretation thus you might as well make a reference to absurdity and say abortion is allowed simply because people say it is , no reason to give this is because the argument from sapience is equivalent to doing such jean piaget \( http en wikipedia org wiki jean piaget \) tells us that human beings do n't begin to think logically about events and ideas till approximately age 7 we lack a sense of object permanence till around age 2 we also lack the ability to tell that if a object is stretch so that when its skinny there is not less of the object compared to how much was there when it was wider in till we reach a later age it would be difficult to consider anyone a human person with out the last 2 abilities also i must mention , fetuses are simply human there is no such thing as sub human the idea of sub human is a horrible one it suggests a hierarchy of organisms with humanity at the top , and because of humanities superiority \( superiority according to what standard \?

abortion,"i wrote this speech read it and it will answer your questions abortion choose life it begins at conception think about this a girl had an abortion , thinking that the baby wasnt living so it wouldnt matter but , after she had the abortion , she saw what she thought wasnt living , and it actually was the baby was living and she watched it die from then on , she couldnt even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being this story that i just told you is true a lot of women think that it isnt a baby before they have the abortion , and i will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby well , if life doesnt begin at birth , then when does it begin \? life begins at conception this is a fact , because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up for example , there is scientific proof and there is biblical proof to further explain what abortion is , i will talk about these important things one , it is spiritually right that life begins at conception , two , how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception , three , what we can do about the abortions , and finally , why girls get abortions those are all the things that should be thought about , so i will be explaining them , to help you understand them some woman have abortions because of these three things one , they might think that theyre too young to have a baby , two , their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion , three , if they do have the abortion the girls parents would get mad at her the case also might be that she just doesnt want to deal with the baby first , you probably ought to know what abortion is abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant every year 1 5 million babies are killed by abortion thats 125 , 000 babies killed a month , making it 4 , 000 babies killed each day , or one baby killed every 20 seconds , that is so amazingly awful that is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds how brutal the fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right as it says in the bible jeremiah 1 5 says , before i formed you in the womb , i knew you , before you were born i set you apart the bible says that life begins at conception , meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being there are many bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception , like the one i just said that bible verse , jeremiah 1 5 is saying that god intended a unique human being , starting at conception just because you cant see or feel the baby inside of you , doesnt mean its not a baby , and alive and a human being , just like you that is what a lot of people do not think about , even though you really should there also is scientific proof some people may think that life begins at birth , or some people even later , but that is wrong , life begins at conception because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception , then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being for example , the heart beat starts gradually , over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life also , dna defines a separate human being , and so when does a person form their own dna \? a person gets their own dna at conception that is a whole lot of proof , so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old , so why isnt it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the mothers womb \? that is a question that probably will go unanswered forever , or they will just say that the baby is not living , which is a complete lie now , what can we do about abortion \? there many things that we can do about abortion if you start supporting this pro life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down , and the law will have to change but , most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion , and save the innocent little babies now , how can we stop abortion \? there are many ways to help stop abortion another way is you can donate money to a place like the pregnancy resource center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion you can also write to the president or another government representative , and tell them about all this proof that i have told you , hoping that their hearts will change and then the law in conclusion to all of this , it is spiritually right that life begins at conception , and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception there are many ways that you can help stop abortion , so i hope that you take a while and do that there are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion , so you really should not have one just remember that god loves the person getting the abortion and the beautiful , innocent little babies thank you and i hope that you have realized that life begins at conception , you should help the pro life movement , and that having an abortion is wrong words 981","um , that doesnt prove anything except what it actually is when a woman becomes pregnant she starts going through a hormonal change to adjust for this really huge thing that is about to happen to her life it is natures way of preparing a woman for motherhood when the baby is lost , through abortion , miscarriage , or accident , all women go back to normal hormones in a quick fashion and it causes depression if you think that a woman feeling guilty about the abortion isnt misplaced emotion then let me tell you a general story that i am sure relates to every woman on the planet when you get all emotional and upset because your bf or husband does not put the dishes in the right place or some other lame ass reason for getting upset , do you really think that that is really the issue \? is it really not your period or your mom not listening to you \? yes it is so misunderstanding your emotions and where they stem from is how you define woman",-1,+1,0

if a person shoots and kills a pregnant woman , should n't the punishment be more severe \? if you legalize abortion , it would tell the courts there is no difference abortion exposes women to various health risks and the danger of losing fertility abortion exposes woman to a number of health risks including , but not limited to , infection , sterility , and in rare cases , death a number of short term symptoms such as bleeding , fever , nausea , and vomiting are also common abortion is against doctors' hippocratic oath every american doctor must take this fundamental oath , which says first , do no harm it threatens the very fabric of the entire medical field if doctors start using their own personal philosophies on life to decide who should or should n't be harmed whether or not you think abortion should be allowed , it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism killing a human being does n't serve any higher medical purpose and is therefore a violation of the oath","ok firstly , i can find about 50 things wrong with your essay you have spurious reasoning , invalid statistics , and a clearly bias and ethno centric view however i have arthritis and the clock is ticking for me to tell you as much as i can as to why this essay , is poorly executed , and appallingly deceptive when a pregnant women feels a kick in her belly , she does n't say oh , the fetus kicked or oh , the mass of cells that has n't become a person kicked , she says the baby kicked this statement is full of a personal opinion and doesnt contain one bit of evidence that proves your point when she says baby she uses it as a euphemism however it doesnt matter how she uses , this statement is completely irrelevant to the argument of an un born childs self awareness self awareness is what defines a human spirit \( or soul if it helps \) hence this is a totally stupefied argument that does not prove your thesis if you dont know how or what self awareness has to do with the topic of abortion , you shouldnt even be allowed to make a post at all yes , after conception you have a real human being waiting to enter the world why should taking someone 's life when they 're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they 're a baby in the crib \? you again back up your statements , not with relevant statistics and data , but with personalized opinion the question of the debate was abortion for or against with this , you should build an argument based on valid points , not perspective have a real human being waiting to enter the world it weird how you make use of the word real as a twig is real a rock is real even dirt everything in the physical universe is real so of course an unborn baby is real , what does that prove \? why should taking someone 's life when they 're in the womb be any different than taking their life when they 're a baby in the crib \? again , your purely prejudice statement is not backed up by any kind of fact this is what debating is , you give fact in exchange for credibility also when you use a statement that implies taking life is wrong , you lay completely oblivious to the fact that as an omnivore you are involved in the deaths of hundreds of animals , hundreds of plant material and every time you wash your hands you are killing germs ! you have to be clear how you direct these statements because they are meaningless in this kind of topic pro choice advocates claim this is n't a real baby only to justify their wrong acts in their own minds they use arguments to justify there opinion , which is exactly what you are doing now they never bluntly say an unborn child is not a sapient being without having reason to believe so if they do say so , then ask them why and they will give you an erudite answer again you use the phrase , wrong acts in their own minds , partly reflecting an un backed opinion and a nave statement reflecting your mis interpretation the pro choice cause women can so callously stomp out a living being simply because they 're inconvenienced this quote only proves you have little and a very subtracted view of why a woman would have abortion inconvenient , in the way you are implying suggests that all woman , despite rape , teen pregnancy , financial instability and risk of life to mother are inadequate reasons to have an abortion in fact you put them in a light that makes them look greedy and unwilling when you use the word callous , you unreasonably sensationalize your argument implying you have reason to change peoples opinion for personal gain rather than stating relevant statistics and articulately explaining as to why your view is more feasible abortion should n't be a form of birth control this statement implies that you have no understanding of what birth control is as the word explains it itself it is to regulate the chance of contraception abortion is used after contraception and isnt used to prevent it 100 percent effective one abstinence maybe if abortion was n't available , people would n't be so careless in the first place abstinence being taught in schools is the reason why children are deprived of sexual education sex ed , was implemented to combat the failure of abstinence teachings as unplanned pregnancy skyrocketed from the 1950 to this day and is still going up if abortion was n't available , people would n't be so careless in the first place i have a suggestion , why dont you conduct a study proving your thesis \? youre saying that abortion availability determines the amount of unplanned pregnancies \? firstly , ruling out abortion all together wont stop abortion it will just be conducted in an illegal fashion and will be incredibly unsafe every year , about 19 20 million are done by individuals without the requisite skills 68 , 000 woman die as a resultmany woman travel to third world countries where abortions are legal world health organization what would you do if you knew the child would have an intelligence level lower than that required to enter public school \? would you still have the child or would you want an abortion \? this is the kind of backwards thinking youre suggesting we make we cut back on vital scientific research with the intention of leaving us in the dark about our childrens future complications with no in depth analysis as to why abortion is wrong on a philosophical and scientific scale , you have no structure to base your banning of genetic research on legalized abortion could turn babies into science experiments if your making assonance to anti stem cell research , you obviously have no clue about prosthetic stem cells that are not derived from a fetus if not then i apologize as this sentence was totally random and had a hardly visible connection to your argument also who cares if babies , sapient or not become science experiments babies are tested all the time firstly they are tested for blood levels and all that sought they are analyzed for the sake of statistics and data they wont be dissected if thats what youre suggesting an unborn baby , assumedly an aborted fetus , is ripe for scientific discovery on the other hand again with no analysis as to why abortion is wrong , you have no right to say why experimenting on an aborted fetus is wrong abortion eliminates legal rights of the unborn child if an unborn being never comes into existence in the first place , it cant make a choices nonetheless hence it is fallacious to ask weather its ethical to steal the right of a non existing , un spiritual and imamate being as rights are exclusively to the human beings , not the fetus the documents of our founding fathers state that we are all entitled to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness what makes you think that when he said we , he was referring to humans and fetuses \? a fetus is a tangible object with potential for sapience but with no current consciousness so how can it be that an object without any mind of its own be able to possess rights that overcome it in depth \? by legalizing abortion , we take those rights away from a future american citizen by that logic it means if i was choosing to become an american citizen in the near future , i am already entitled to american rights i live in australia and i am now able to possess guns , not use the metric system and pay tax to america rather than australia how can that possibly make sense to you \? abortion is against doctors' hippocratic oath just so you know the term hippocratic oath wasnt named that way because it was hypocrisy , it was because it was named after the greek philosopher hippocrates every american doctor must take this fundamental oath , which says first , do no harm almost all schools in america have abandoned that oath since 1970 its meaningless it threatens the very fabric of the entire medical field if doctors start using their own personal philosophies on life to decide who should or should n't be harmed an abortion is a patients choice , not a doctors choice whether or not you think abortion should be allowed , it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism again living organism is a wrong word to use as i said before , living organism encompasses all life forms including bacteria , animals and plant life yes it is harming it but not harming a sapient , free thinking being i hope you have the audacity to read and digest this information i suggest you should read the rest of my material on this debate as you will soon find out that abortion is not a black and white topic but it truly relative i hope you will also see that you have to use relevant data to back up your information rather than basing it on solid opinions",-1,+1,0

abortion,"aside from religious views , there are more ways to look at abortion by any means , abortion should never be encouraged because it is , indeed the killing of a life and we do not have the right to determine the undertaking of any life , save for our own however , there are exceptional cases where abortion would be acceptable please tell me why you are the authority on which 'killings' are okay , and which are not first and foremost abortion should never occur simply because of teenage pregnancy a reason for abortion that has become more prevalent in recent years that is because teenagers have to understand and take up the responsibility of what they have done if they had had sex , then it 's of utmost importance that they take up any consequences that come along with it thus abortion should not be encouraged if it is an escape route for people to run away from problems abortion is a consequence do you think it is a comfortable , fun activity people undergo in their leisure time \? it is an emotionally trying , incredibly difficult decision to make , and it can be a scary and uncomfortable procedure in the best of cases especially for young people , it may be one of the most trying and terrifying periods of their lives it is sadistic to force teenage girl through a pregnancy because her judgment lapsed , or her contraception failed her do you also advocate that if someone gets a curable disease from sex , that they do not seek treatment because it would be 'running away from problems' and refusing to 'take up consequences' \? but , however , there are also reasons why abortion should be acceptable and one reason would be if it puts the mother 's health at risk if the mother of the child faces numerous health issues such a cancer , high blood pressure , it is of grave importance that we weight the pros and cons of the pregnancy for if the childbirth of a newborn forsakes the life of the mother , are n't we killing another life as well \? of course , it is up to the couple as to whether which option they wish to take , but their opinions should be duly respected because the mother 's life is at risk it 's sweet that you are so concerned about the mother 's life i only wish you were as concerned about her right to not be relegated to the rank of incubating machine for a fetus she does n't want stop using 'we' as if a pregnancy between two people who are not you is an event in which your opinion matters","please tell me why you are the authority on which 'killings' are okay , and which are not first and foremost , i never deemed myself as the authority or make it mandatory for people to strictly follow what i deem as acceptable or unacceptable situations for abortion instead , what i did was set out generic examples on why abortion should be acceptable and unacceptable if we were to debate about specific cases , there would be no end to possibilities that we could conjure and secondly , i never wrote that 'killings were okay' , i used the word acceptable throughout my point , and that brings a different weightage and seriousness to the issue not just one where , it is okay or not okay as if we were picking vegetables at a supermarket abortion is a consequence do you think it is a comfortable , fun activity people undergo in their leisure time \? it is an emotionally trying , incredibly difficult decision to make , and it can be a scary and uncomfortable procedure in the best of cases especially for young people , it may be one of the most trying and terrifying periods of their lives it is sadistic to force teenage girl through a pregnancy because her judgment lapsed , or her contraception failed her do you also advocate that if someone gets a curable disease from sex , that they do not seek treatment because it would be 'running away from problems' and refusing to 'take up consequences' \? i never implied that abortion is a painless process , it is a very physically and emotionally painful process that may scar one for life but what i'm trying to say here is that , teenagers should not treat abortion as a last minute measure to 'save themselves' when they indulge in that momentary 'lapse of judgement' instead , they should face up to what they have did and actually consider about raising the life that they created and not kill it simply because they just wanted the pleasure of sex at the point and nothing else of course i'm generalizing here by saying that teenagers are irresponsible people , but truth be told , many teenagers choose abortion as the easy way out , when actually they might be able to raise a child with the support of their families how then , should abortion amongst these teenagers be condoned \? moreover , having curable diseases \( i presume you 're referring to stds in this case \) is yet another responsibility that has to be undertaken because of what you mentioned a 'lapse of judgment' stds occur , why \? because both parties were n't truthful about their past sexual experiences or had numerous sexual partners \? if that was a mistake on their part , then yes , they should face it in the same way we should consider both abortion and having a family and not just choose abortion as the easy route route besides , when you 're sick , you get treated am i right \? there 's only one option when one is pregnant , she can choose to keep the child or abort it , that 's two options i see no relation between the two issues it 's sweet that you are so concerned about the mother 's life i only wish you were as concerned about her right to not be relegated to the rank of incubating machine for a fetus she does n't want stop using 'we' as if a pregnancy between two people who are not you is an event in which your opinion matters i do not see how you have thought of me treating the mother as an incubating machine for if i were to have done that , i would not have brought up the point pertaining to the mother 's health risks during the pregnancy and it 's grave importance and secondly , i do not see why you have labelled a mother for incubating a fetus she does n't want for if she does n't want the fetus , she would not have gotten pregnant in the first place would she \? lastly , i have actually simply gave my honest opinions on the issue and not forced my opinions i never said that if a mother is not in the perfect health state , she should definitely abort the baby i instead mentioned that the couple 's opinions should be duly respected and of course , be of the most importance i simply brought up the point in which if a mother 's health is at risk , abortion would be acceptable to avoid the loss of an innocent life at the expense of another",+1,-1,0
abortion,"in your hypothetical , the woman is not aware of the impending accident if a person goes hiking , they are n't expecting of an accident to occur , or they would not have undertaken it in the first place pregnancy is different because it requires sex which is a decision that everyone knows may result in pregnancy now you may think , taking a hike in no man 's land is also a decision that includes risk and you 'd be right but i believe this is where the debate breaks down to individual opinion i am of the opinion that when a person becomes a parent \( by deliberate decision or otherwise \) they are responsible for the safety of that new human even to the extent of risking their own lives that is my definition of assuming responsibility for the risks that being said , i do n't think there should be laws in place to force people to carry thorough a pregnancy , or donate blood to their injured child but i believe it to be immoral for a parent to favor their own safety over that of their children born or not","i respectfully think you are wrong hiking is not dangerous really mountain climbing on the other hand is you take risks to do it this is taking responsiblity for your actions even if the risks you took backfired and became reality and this is the case for intercourse between a man and a woman the risk is always there unless the woman or the man is sterile if a woman has sexual intercourse with a man who was wearing protection and that protection broke how do you think she would feel \? anxious \? worried \? if a woman who takes the pill had sex with a man and later learned she forget to take one the day before how would she feel \? worried \? sure she would because mistakes happen but that does not change the risk factor that she took the risk was there and human error , condom malfunctions can happen how is that the fault of the new life they both created \? it is unfortunate , but nevertheless , the life got started i dont think it should be individual opinion it should be what the facts state and it is a fact that at conception that which is living in the womb is a human being now its small , but that does not change its state a little ant working hard on a hill has all it needs to live its small but the workings of his bodily system works and a fetus however small has the same qualities but is human the heart starts at around twenty days and every day grows and something develops the issue is does anyone have the right to kill a living human being without its concent we have people here who are against killing animals for food , but they are pro abortion and believe killing humans is obviously more moral figure that one out if you say they are responsible is the responsible thing to do is kill it \? how responsible is that \? do you think that two wrongs make a right \? you say there should be no laws to enslave the woman , that she should not be forced to carry a baby to full term that means in your statement that you also would condone abortion in the ninth month so do n't come back and say ooops now i do n't mean that only until its viable and gee when is viablity and what does that matter the woman does not want it and by your own statement should be allow to kill it whenever she wants anythink less as i said would enslave her and force her to do what you say , no one should be allowed to do in this case our government how humane is your statement really \? donating blood does not kill anyone and in the united states we can really force people to give blood when someone is arrested for drunk driving most often they have to give blood denying it would really be an admission of guilt and the arresting officer can use it as evidence i do n't get that you think its immoral for a parent to favor their own safety over their childs , yet believe the mother can kill her child while it is in the womb \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? yours is certainly not the republican stance thats for sure",-1,+1,0

every woman that has a child is single and goes after the father for child support \? not that this has any relevance to abortion since the child would have to be born for a father to pay for it the man deposits the sperm and that is it she allows him to do this sexist again he allows himself to do it as much as she allows him then why deny him the right to decide what happens to his child i do n't deny him the right the mother does , not once have i said this is right or correct stop putting words into my mouth and they are n't always denied the right anyway a lot of woman consult with the father before having a termination and your giving her a pity party so any father who provides for his child , within a relationship or not , is simply giving their child money out of pity \? do n't be so idiotic and stop implying that all a father does is pay money he cares for the child as much as the mother and by the way , damn right he should pay he had sex without contraception he knew the consequences as much as the woman , he should be involved with providing financially as much the mother ! brown was no more part of her mothers body when placed there than she had been part of the petri dish where she was concieved a child is not part of the body in which she is carried since a unborn baby relies on the mother to provide for it through the umbilical cord of course it 's a part of her the embryo did n't rely on the petri dish to nurture and nourish it but then in your opinion a poor baby , a handicapped baby should be left to die they are not worthy to live i try my best to avoid getting angry but you just keep making up awful lies about me i not once said anyone is n't worthy to live or deserves to die i said i understand if a woman wants to have an abortion for these reasons you are a blamer wow no woman is dragged into an abortion clinic who did i blame \? when did i say a woman is dragged into an abortion clinic \? look debate with me all you like but do n't for one moment assume that you know everything about my opinions and thoughts instead of accusing me of ludicrous opinions and awful things that i have said not said perhaps ask for my view on a topic",-1,+1,0
abortion,why should n't it matter \? does n't everything deserve a chance \? the fetus ca n't even protect itself or have any say in it that 's not fair to just say i'm going to end something someone 's life and there is absolutely nothing nobody can do about it and you still did n't answer the question,"why should n't it matter \? it is n't a life yet you are a life , i am a life we have memories , minds , identities a foetus has none of this , it is alive without being a proper life that is why there is no problem with it does n't everything deserve a chance \? rationally speaking , no life has limited resources , and one of those resources is family only so many loving , positive families exist , and abortion prevents a a child from being raised as a burden why would you want a child to be raised in a family that was unprepared \? why should a child exist in a loveless or incompetent family \? why should a child become an orphan \? children need deep emotional bonds to become good people you are supporting a belief that causes inconvenient children to roam the world , growing up into social problems and criminal elements the fetus ca n't even protect itself or have any say in it that 's because a foetus is n't self aware it 's a protohuman , it may be alive but it is n't aware of itself that 's not fair to just say i'm going to end something someone 's life and there is absolutely nothing nobody can do about it i believe the abortion issue of today evolved with the far right 's displeasure of reduced gender roles brought on by feminism abortion is the ultimate sign of a woman 's ownership of her body something that was traditionally left up to chance is now within her control , and a man can no longer force her to become a mother who stays at home , giving up her dreams it is her choice now , too i think that abortion is one of those emotional issues which everyone has a feeling about , but as a matter of private thought , yet politicians capitalised upon it as a means of dividing people and pulling them to support a movement they might otherwise ignore in other words , abortion like pregnancy is a private issue that is frankly none of our business when it concerns someone else the reason we keep it legal is so that a woman may choose to exercise control over her body should the need arise",-1,+1,0

no more so then religion is at least my danger is in the name of logical progression of society and whether or not you see it that way is irrelevant you seem to refer to hitler in most of your debates , i believe mao zedong would be a much better example for the logic you are using , just a suggestion i find what you say about men and abortion commical i am certainly praying at this point you have no children and wo n't i can only imagine how they would be raised i be a wonderful dad , i would let them grow their own beliefs on god and structure , those things are up to them to figure out my duty would be protection and learning of basic functions it is not my place in my standing to dictate how my child views thing in the world around him if he wants to be pro life , all the power to him , as long as he \( or she \) truly believes in what the hold i am fine you say the woman should have the say and then you want to be excused from parenting if its your sperm that impregnated the woman and you dont want the baby ahhhh you poor thing not included yes i do believe that i do n't think he should be able to back out if he decides to pay child support , but i do believe he should have a choice that is probably the most destructive belief i have portrayed , but to win some you gotta give some , and the women won rights to chose whether or not they have an abortion libertarian worldview all about themselves , nothing about anyone else a cold cold unliveable philiosophy of life liberty for your kind is slavery , killing those they think are unworthy to live freedom of expression for you people is the gun pointed at someones head no absolutes people just doing what they want to do even if it hurts society , even if it hurts their own family that is incorrect to the extreme but i am not here to argue my party standings i could go on about your religion and get quite insulting , but for the sake of argument i hope you will drop your attacks on the libertarian party and respect us for our views as i have respected you without insult \( if one has slipped through the cracks i apologize , but i do n't remember making an insult \) your views are radical and your right you dont care about anything moral that speak to your conscience and lack of one for you rape could be good in some circumstances and well we know your all for killing those that you dont think deserve to live god only knows who is in that group yes they are radical , i am not going to deny that and there is no such thing as moral or right or wrong i think in terms such as beneficial and destructive and god does n't know because he does n't exist i may seem colder then usually imaginable , but when faced with issue such as abortion we must think about what is best for society and i am actually quite the party animal , but here i am here to be logical and maybe have a beer when done your worldview is not logical at all in fact i find it hidiously evil and dangerous it strips away the preciousness of life and living what a sad world you live in which is why those that value life need to keep you close it is logical as all my views come from a deep understanding of political theory and my understanding of what makes the human mind and what differentiates it from that of an animal \( not much \) no such thing as evil , said that already and you misunderstand my intentions in benefiting society we promote what makes us human progression , thinking , in making society a better place we make the world a better place and my world is sad by no means i seek only to progress my knowledge and thoughts of world issues i thank you for having the courtesy of making a quite lengthy response",-1,+1,0

consenting , mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries which brings me to a question for you if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love , is that wrong \? there 's a 30 year difference , as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference it 's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love , so why should n't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically \? do you not see the whole in that logic \? a consenting , understanding person is a consenting , understanding person regardless of age children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex some underage teenagers , on the other hand , are , by mathematical probability mutual , understanding , consenting love should n't be restricted by the law , and if you have any compassion , you 'll have an imagination and agree with me facts i know about abortion \? facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves , and therefore a consciousness , until a certain stage in the pregnancy that 's a fact duh i 've said that about a dozen times to you it 's funny how you 've showed your obliviousness to everything i 've been saying by asking for the facts i 've been repeating to you over and over again yes , the fact is that a fetus , after a certain point , is a human being it has a consciousness before that certain point , it has no consciousness now , i'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on what is your proof that a fetus is a human being before it has a consciousness \? i agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being you think that it 's always a human being , period give me proof that it is a human being , period , regardless of having a consciousness or not i'm not 'pro abortion' i have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro abortion' stop saying that i'm 'pro abortion' before i decide to call you a dumb twat , you oblivious nincompoop yup , i'm god everything is god you 're god to , you know no , it is a fact that under certain circumstances , sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult , therefore it is not wrong if it does n't harm them , how is it wrong \? cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate , depending on their mentality some people do n't mind open relationships because they are n't emotionally damaged by cheating therefore , for them , cheating is not wrong the same applies to lying and stealing example for lying you 're a jew living in germany it 's 1938 you look a little more german then jewish nazis ask you if you and your family are jewish you lie and say you 're not jewish you save your family and yourself if you think that lie was wrong , you are a naive , brainwashed fool have an imagination that factors in circumstance example of stealing you 're poor and starving so is your family a rich man leaves his car unlocked his wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car you steal the money and leave the wallet you stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job if you think stealing in that case was wrong , then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of robin hood child abuse is never wrong , because it 's abuse abuse is to harm someone for no reason harm is infallible child abuse is never right i do not defend evil i defend only good you are just a humongous idiot in fact , you defend evil if you think that the jew in 1938 should n't have lied , if you think the stealing man should n't have feed his family , and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life do you support these things \? i hope you say no in the case that you say yes , you are an evil piece of shit you believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people in which case , you deserve the hell of the black and white christianity you so believe in but , i do n't even think you are brainwashed enough to say 'yes' i'm glad you wo n't you failed to understand what i said , again fool people who are unconscious still have a consciousness when you sleep , your brain is a billion times more active then when you 're awake the same goes for comas they have a consciousness , and therefore we know that they have a soul a fetus , on the other hand , is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy to be unconscious , you must have a consciousness in the first place until a certain point , a fetus has no consciousness , therefore it is not 'unconscious' it has no soul unless you can prove to me that it has a soul without having a consciousness of course your baby would do that , it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still ! it was human ! but you know what \? it was n't human the second it 's halves came together and fertilized unless you can prove that it had a soul without having a consciousness no you are sad you are the saddest sad person to ever be sad you 're the coldest thing to ever exist my mother died in a car accident at the age of 73 we kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died you despicable c no , i 'll stop from saying that insult but you are despicable vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness they are not comatose they are not unconscious they have no consciousness whatsoever i feel sad for you , being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious less piece of meat alive is right to classify a conscious less piece of meat as a human being is correct how about we classify severed limbs as people to , then huh \? then people wo n't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy instead they 'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being i 'd say screw you , but you know what i do n't need to your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are a soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness prove to me that a soul can exist in human flesh without it having a consciousness do it ! because if you ca n't , you cannot prove me wrong and never will !",-1,+1,0
abortion,"you keep saying that it 's human , which i agree with you the points of difference seems to be that i regard it as a potential up to a certain point , whereas you think of it more as a definite you then argue that it deserves all the same rights as that of people i do n't agree i'm afraid it does n't deserve the same rights and you can call this discrimination based on level of development \) \( not based on level of dependency as you keep saying \) until it passes a certain stage in its development \( mental and physical \) , it should n't have any rights whatsoever","here is what i think you are saying by potential life this human after a certain point can go on and have a life and by life i'm guessing you mean it in the generic sense , meaning the totality of ones existence , a life lived here is why i think that is a dangerous position to hold basing the value of a human on it 's potential is a subjective value judgment , someone other than the human in question decides the value of the human life if someone decides that the life of someone else is not valuable they then are free to dispose of it that 's dangerous because that is how germany began the road to the holocaust it started with the sick , mentally retarded and elderly the did it by making the value judgment that certain humans did n't have potential , they held no value for society and following darwin 's model of survival of the fittest it was only logical to dispose of them see potential is a very vague and subjective term that can be defined in a multitude of different ways , it 's what 's know as an equivocal word you see when a value judgment is subjective the line between value and no value can be easily moved to suite the desire of the one with power making every human at risk , even you the safer ground to stand on is objective value the value of the human is in the human itself by the fact that it is human gives it it 's value this puts all humans on a level playing field i ca n't come up to you and because i have more power than you say your life is not as valuable as mine taking the position of objective value protects the weakest and most vulnerable members of the human race we are not free to exploit them because we are more powerful i hope you see that by making this subjective value judgment of another human being you have raised yourself above them because you are more powerful and now because of your power over them you can kill them freely , this is nothing short of the exploitation of the weakest and most vulnerable humans conscience ought to tell you that we should protect them , not exploit them",+1,-1,0
abortion,is n't animal cruelty a crime \? animals are technically not people so should n't it apply to unborn humans when one ends their life \? ending a life is n't cruel cruelty specifically refers to negligence and mistreatment like physical abuse,"what \? ending a life is n't cruel \? so i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you these are the cruel methods stated again methods of termnation of pregnancy there are three abortion classificationssurgical abortion , medical abortion , and chemical abortion they are defined as follows surgical abortion these are abortions that involve an invasive procedure major types of surgical abortions include suction aspiration this is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy \( the first three months \) the abortionist inserts a suction tube \( similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end \) into the mother 's womb the suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle dilation and curettage \( d c \) in this procedure , the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall the baby 's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother 's womb dilation and extraction \( also known as d x or partial birth abortion \) used to kill babies well into the third trimester \( as late as 32 weeks old \) , the abortionist reaches into the mother 's womb , grabs the baby 's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother , except for the head the abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby 's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby 's skull the abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby 's brain out the forceps are then used to crush the baby 's head and the abortionist pulls the baby 's body out the rest of the way dilation and evacuation \( d e \) this form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester \( 24 weeks \) the abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby \( arms and legs \) and then tears the baby apart the baby 's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby 's growth hysterotomy performed in the third trimester , this is basically an abortive cesarean section \( c section \) the abortionist makes in an incision in the mother 's abdomen and removes the baby the baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse medical abortions these are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child common drugs used for medical abortions include mifepristone \( ru 486 \) mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy \( progesterone \) this lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby the tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug , misoprostol , causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb methotrexate this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby 's fast growing cells it also attacks the life support systems the baby needs to survive when the systems fail , the baby dies misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb salt poisoning this technique is used in the second and third trimester the abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother 's womb the needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby the baby breathes in , swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning , dehydration , brain hemorrhage and convulsions taking nearly an hour to die , the baby 's skin is completely burned , turns red and deteriorates the baby is in pain the entire time the mother goes into labor 24 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby prostaglandins used during the second and third trimester , prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac , causing violent premature labor during these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving chemical abortions these are abortions caused by drugs that , at least some of the time , prevent the implantation of the already created baby in the uterine lining some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly created children are the ortho evra birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins , which may inhibit ovulation , change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly formed human \( physicians' desk reference 60 ed montvale , nj thompson pdr 2006 2402 \) the nuvaring vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins , which may inhibit ovulation , change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly formed human \( pdr 2357 \) depo provera contraceptive injection , when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months , inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which , in turn , prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning these actions produce its contraceptive effect \( pdr 2620 \) plan b is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization , by altering the tubal transport of sperm and or ova in addition , it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium \( pdr 1068",+1,-1,0

i may not be able to convince you , but there are plenty of occasions where pregnancy and childbirth result in a stronger more healthy woman as it is a difficult experience , i do n't doubt makes some women stronger it could also break her or ruin her life if she ca n't deal with it , or if her life simply has no room for the resources pregnancy requires there is probably a reason abortion correlates so heavily with poverty i do n't think it 's the job of society to shame someone who chooses not to take a more difficult path , mainly because they have a way better idea than anyone else if they can actually handle it or not you and i are both in situations that we could undoubtedly complicate by taking on more responsibilities or demands , but we have n't because we 're aware that we have our limits and everything will suffer if we overextend ourselves is that unacceptable \?

abortion,"i 'd like to take the time to address several tings that have been raised in this debate and clarify my argument against abortion first , the affect this debate has on women who have had abortions this reality has weighed heavily on my conscience but i think a greater issue is at stake here and therefore the cost is worth it the greater good that is being served here is the hope that abortion on demand might someday be ended and that the emotional trauma it causes to women will be ended also the holocaust of abortion will not be ended until people see and know the reality of what it is it has been stunning to see through the course of this debate the lengths people will go to so as to sugar coat this issue and make it appear not so bad and actually justifiable so my effort is to make that know as best i can but the truth is that when women , who have had abortions , come to a correct understanding of what has happened there is real pain and real quilt and that certainly is not to be dismissed so for those who have had abortions i say there is a way out of the pain and quilt true forgiveness is possible there is only one way out and that is through the great exchange god in christ takes your life and he gives you his when he died , you died and the charges against you are paid in full , the debt is canceled then the life of perfection he lived becomes yours it is laid to your account so you go from an infinity negative debt to an infinity positive righteousness and through his resurrection you are raised to newness of life this is only possible through repentance and faith confess your sins and trust god to do for you what he said he would in christ this faith is not a leap in the dark , like crossing your fingers it is an active trust , like standing on solid ground a confident expectation in the faithfulness of god with that said i would like to clarify my argument against abortion further and answer the question should abortion be banned but let me preface my argument with a disclaimer i realize there is a difference between proof and persuasion there is no argument that i can put forth that ca n't be disputed there are actually people who will argue for the reality of square circles so i put this argument forth for those who are truly open minded in hopes you will be persuaded the taking of the life of an innocent human being without proper justification is murder and murder is illegal abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification therefore it is murder and should be illegal","during the holocaust , approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945 these people include jews , homosexuals , slavics \( russians , poles , and others \) , gypsies , mentally and physically disabled , communists , socialists , jehovah 's witnesses , and christians found helping the targeted people that was fifty years ago and today hitler and the nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers but why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers \? from 1973 to 2005 , over 46 million abortions have been performed this is much higher death rate than from the holocaust for abortion the approximate death rate is 1 4 million babies each year the approximate death rate for the holocaust , however , is about 917 thousand people a year the nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children to this day , germans have collective shame because of what the nazis did , even though they did nothing to help in fifty years will americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed \? will americans be known as mass murderers and criminals \? the subject of abortion and the holocaust are very closely related subjects the jews were killed because they were unwanted and inconvenient a child is aborted because they are unwanted and inconvenient i want you to tell me the holocaust was wrong and then tell me abortion is okay you just ca n't do that one ca n't be wrong and the other right that is like saying rape is wrong but incest is okay",-1,-1,1

abortion,"i'm against abortions for the most part i do n't believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control as with upwards of 80 of the cases there are ways to prevent pregnancy which are very effective and to me if a person ignores the use of birth control they should assume responsibility for their actions on the other hand , there are many instances where birth control has failed , cannot be taken due to allergies , or where rape is a contributing factor to where i would support a womans decision if she where to not go through with the pregnancy as for not being able to sustain a baby financially , emotionally , or intellectually , adoption is an option , saying that you want to abort because you did n't feel like taking or wearing birth control is a poor excuse and should n't be encouraged or supported","there are many instances where birth control has failed yes , because of awful application or use of the birth control items if every time you had sex you knew there was a large chance you would become pregnant because birth control is not an option due to allergies , i think you should at least think of consequences before you have sex",+1,-1,0
abortion,"so the woman takes the chance , it is her decision , her responsibilty you really are a sexist pig the male who has sex with her and impregnates takes half the responsibility for pregnancy it 's not solely a woman why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion because if a child is going to make her life more awful than what she 's already experienced she has the choice to not go through that i'm not saying you should abort in these circumstances but i understand entirely why people do and are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die \? you are possibly the biggest word mincer ever i personally would n't abort a child on these grounds and i'm not saying people should but yet again i understand and sympathize with someone who does hitler had the same idea did you know that \? stop calling and comparing me to hitler it 's so rude you are making excuses for the killing i'm not making excuses i'm saying i understand why woman would abort in these situations stop acting like i advocate death and i'm murdering people how about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks i think that 's probably a very selfish reason however i do n't know the woman 's background maybe she has serious depression and her self esteem is low hence i said life would be impacted seriously \( not superficially \) oh and in response to your question about i meant , i mean personally if someone were to abort because it was the wrong sex or something along those lines i 'd probably think it was a bit selfish but i would n't out right deny the woman the right to do so and do n't call me a hypocrite , because i still believe the woman has the right to abort under those circumstances what right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time this is coming from the person who believes a woman has no right to abort at all \? a woman can abort for whatever reason she likes it has nothing to with me i 've never led you to believe that i think only some woman can abort and just to clarify i 've already posted the scientific studies and facts on when a baby feels pain and it 's brain is active , and why that is my defining limit on abortion gestation with some exception if you could n't be bothered to read it that 's your problem","what i just said is fact like it or not you want to say that abortion should be legal because its her body her decision but then you want to blame the man for the risk she took you look silly our laws say that the baby is not his enough to be a part of the decision he has no choice in the matter why men do n't see this and storm in outrage i do n't know who is the one that gets pregnant \? can the man get pregnant \? who takes the risk \? either you are so young that you do n't know better or i just do n't know , your ignorant about what responsiblity is you are cold but then you respresent death to innocent human beings because you are a pro abort you champion killing and that is what abortion is whether its in the first month or ninth , its killing the abortionists goal isnt to shoot a documentary , or catch a fish , or play a round of golf it is to kill that which is in the womans womb it got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her she is the one taking the risk not the man you 're a typical pro abort all over the place , not consistent at all sigh if a child is gonna make her life awful kill it lmao so compassionate of you catticus is there something wrong with abortion or not \? you personally believe but you still condone yes , but no but maybe you gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting you personally wouldnt abort on these grounds well my dear what grounds would you kill \? i bring up hitler because margaret sanger influenced him and she was the founder of planned parenthood your views on this mirror theirs because they acted them out do some research and you will see google sanger and hitler then see if you agree with them if you do n't i would like to know what you disagree with them on you call me a pig and then tell me i am mean for comparing your views to hitler \? come on lol do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children do you also defend people who murder , rape , steal \? hell you make excuses for everything you are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn you are saying death should always be an option how do you go to bat for the innocent in the womb \? you do n't you think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks , it was the wrong sex but its ok , if its deformed do you ever read what you post here and really really think about what you say and how it sounds you you you think what do you think any aborted child in the womb would say if they could talk \( hell infant babies cant talk either \) and address the one who killed them , the one who presumed they would have a horrible life \? you said you would not deny a woman the right to kill , therefore you are pro abortion , because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed you are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing lol you pro aborts kill me no pun intended what does pain have to do with anything \? the point i was trying to make was that you are probably pro abortion until the time you think the fetus can feel pain and geeze oh petes we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we \? i mean that would be inhumane right \? you are a joke you say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason \( the man is not an issue unless money is involved \) but that it shouldnt be her responsiblity only \( what the man should pay for the killing \? \) you think when the baby can feel pain abortion should not be allowed not allowed after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby might be viable i know the studies i know people who have done the studies the fact is that which is in the womb is human , is alive and is a growing person science is on the side of life and defines it in terms that are not pro choice life was not concieved to kill in this way , it is unfortunate that you and others do not put any worth in the womb",+1,-1,0

abortion,"ok , this is my criticism of the argument for abortion from sapience the argument for abortion from sapience is a valid logical argument known as barbra \( or if your picky you can called it a variation of that argument \) and is as follows 1 all non \( human persons \) are beings which do not have rights 2 all fetuses are non \( human persons \) 3 therefore all fetuses are beings which do not have rights this is indeed barbara \( and a disjunctive syllogism \) 1 all a are b 2 all c are a 3 all c are b the soundness of this argument is completely dependent on the category of non \( human persons \) which is dependent on the category of person this category is ill defined to start with but there are a few things that seems to be commonly agreed on 1 a human person is a human being 2 a human person is a human being with the quality of personhood this forces us to look into personhood , so lets look into it 1 personhood is dependent on the brain , a how developed of a brain \? i how is this decision decided or development measured \? likely by what functions the brain can accomplish , then the importance of those functions would have to be supported ii if the functions of the brain is what decides how developed of a brain then there is two options of approach which are as follows aa the brain needs to demonstrate these functions a lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated , and some will be timed based for even adults thus personhood , and rights become transient rights disappear before death , and depending on what functions also disappear daily rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death bb the brain needs to be capable of these functions arguably this is the same criteria as 1 ii aa since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it capability has two meanings the statistical probability of something happening being high , which is the same as hypothetical ability or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen , also hypothetical \( bad definition i know , but it should be clear and also a important input is time \) what is this something with variable inputs \? is it a brain , the process of brain development , both \? why one over the other options \? in less cases but in some the brains capability of some brain functions changes in the same way as the ability to demonstrate brain functions do most brain functions change with time if we base rights on most brain functions then the existence of any rights at all would be much much more volatile them they actually are keeping all that in mind it seems clear that a human being also being a human person from birth to death is hypothetical , that human beings stop and start being human persons at times and still retain their rights also human beings which lack basic brain functions , such as babies \( object permanence , for example which many animals possess \) , possess rights thus the argument from sapience is unsound premise one is not true the truth value of premise two depends on the definition of personhood the definition of personhood is arbitrary for it depends on a arbitrary selection of brain functions which are themselves usually ill defined and heavily dependent on subjective interpretation thus you might as well make a reference to absurdity and say abortion is allowed simply because people say it is , no reason to give this is because the argument from sapience is equivalent to doing such jean piaget \( http en wikipedia org wiki jean piaget \) tells us that human beings do n't begin to think logically about events and ideas till approximately age 7 we lack a sense of object permanence till around age 2 we also lack the ability to tell that if a object is stretch so that when its skinny there is not less of the object compared to how much was there when it was wider in till we reach a later age it would be difficult to consider anyone a human person with out the last 2 abilities also i must mention , fetuses are simply human there is no such thing as sub human the idea of sub human is a horrible one it suggests a hierarchy of organisms with humanity at the top , and because of humanities superiority \( superiority according to what standard \? \) they are allowed the ability to do what would otherwise be dis moral \( which seems like a non sequitur to me \)","alright , i thought i 'd throw this into the discussion \( a logic bomb \? \) , based upon my research i 've ascertained that the majority of abortions do n't even fall into the argument from sapience http www abortionno org resources fastfacts html http www prochoice org about abortion facts after 12 weeks html name your source , they both agree that the majority of abortions occur before week twelve \( 88 to 89 according to each \) http upload wikimedia org wikipedia commons thumb 5 57 prenatal development table svg 1000px prenatal development table svg png this handy guide shows us that foetal development just barely starts between weeks 10 12 according to wikipedia , the nervous system begins development around week ten so , from all this information , i would make the argument that we can reasonably infer that the majority of abortions involve embryos and foetuses which are either incapable of awareness \( no brain \) or have such a rudimentary system with no inputs that they ca n't be aware in this case i think the remaining 11 to 12 of abortions begin to enter into the argument from sapience which you deconstructed i applaud you for a well reasoned argument , but i had some ideas which were n't considered 1 suppose we start with a reasonable premise that a foetus under 20 weeks of development is less sapient than the mother suppose we accept the definition of personhood where a born person is a person \( as you explained cogently , the definition of a person is quite flexible and arbitrary , at least in a legal sense \) in this case , one could argue that abortion for foetuses under twenty weeks is a matter of granting the mother , who has greater capacity for individuality , thought , and so forth , right over her own body over something which is severely limited in this capacity and is n't yet granted the benefit of the doubt which the title of personhood confers 2 suppose we impart the commonly accepted notion of dead where having a heartbeat qualifies you as being alive into the argument from sapience in this case , all foetuses under nineteen weeks old are abortable because the heart does n't even begin beating until approximately week nineteen it 's reasonable to assume that a being without a functioning heart in this capacity cannot be aware or thinking because these processes require a large amount of energy which is supplied by blood 3 suppose we conduct tests upon developing foetuses' and babies' brains which shows us once and for all that a foetus does n't become a baby until say , week x \( where x is some high week , like between 30 and 36 \) in this case , the argument from sapience plus knowledge from science would give us a more strict window of when a foetus should be rationally protected from abortion 4 this is basically an extended version of 1 , but using practicality as a measure alongside sapience , and with high priority suppose we consider the mother 's rights as a person to be of paramount importance these include a right over her body in this case , it follows that a less developed foetus' life is considered less valuable than the right of a woman to have full control over her reproductive system , even if it means that around 1 of abortions will end the lives of highly developed foetuses we consider their sapience to be less than the woman 's and a sacrifice until a better solution emerges which satisfies the woman 's rights in addition to enabling the foetus to live i 'd like to address some of what you said aa the brain needs to demonstrate these functions a lot of brain functions will not always be demonstrated , and some will be timed based for even adults thus personhood , and rights become transient rights disappear before death , and depending on what functions also disappear daily rights need to be present at least from shortly after birth to death bb the brain needs to be capable of these functions arguably this is the same criteria as 1 ii aa since if the brain is not doing something it could be said that it is impossible for it to not be doing it capability has two meanings the statistical probability of something happening being high , which is the same as hypothetical ability or that something is in such a stage that if its inputs were to change then what it is capable of would happen , also hypothetical \( bad definition i know , but it should be clear and also a important input is time \) what is this something with variable inputs \? is it a brain , the process of brain development , both \? why one over the other options \? i believe that the best answer one can give to your question concerning when a brain has abilities selected by society to make the person eligible for personhood and whether those rights disappear when the functions cease , is that in our society there is a tendency to grant a benefit until exception in other words , under such a proposed society where personhood is granted based on the brain meeting qualifiers , that personhood would continue being granted until aberrant behaviour warrants a retest , and that test reveals something to be lost similar to how a drivers license is granted after some conditions are met , and revoked after you are caught driving drunk for example , not when you happen to drive after drinking a beer \( which technically might disqualify you , but police do n't keep instantaneous tabs on everyone \)",-1,+1,0

life of the person might be in danger which is why a criminal charge has to be instituted the type of cells and tissues however that we are referring to is referred to as a developing human being who is growing into complete human form with a complete dna and blood type but did n't you say that what a woman does with her body is nobody 's business then how come there are laws to prevent her from prostituting her body \? okay according to statistics released by the who in terms of abortion , the number of abortions that performed for the year 1995 45 5 million of which 19 9 million were illegal according to a report from the guttmacher institute , unsafe abortion causes an estimated 70 , 000 deaths each year , and an additional five million women are treated annually for complications resulting from unsafe abortion approximately three million women who experience serious complications from unsafe procedures go untreated the following methods describe the different methods of abortion since you are also a person of science read up on horrifying methods of abortion in which we do not even do this with animals methods of termnation of pregnancy there are three abortion classificationssurgical abortion , medical abortion , and chemical abortion they are defined as follows surgical abortion these are abortions that involve an invasive procedure major types of surgical abortions include suction aspiration this is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy \( the first three months \) the abortionist inserts a suction tube \( similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end \) into the mother 's womb the suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle dilation and curettage \( d c \) in this procedure , the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall the baby 's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother 's womb dilation and extraction \( also known as d x or partial birth abortion \) used to kill babies well into the third trimester \( as late as 32 weeks old \) , the abortionist reaches into the mother 's womb , grabs the baby 's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother , except for the head the abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby 's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby 's skull the abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby 's brain out the forceps are then used to crush the baby 's head and the abortionist pulls the baby 's body out the rest of the way dilation and evacuation \( d e \) this form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester \( 24 weeks \) the abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby \( arms and legs \) and then tears the baby apart the baby 's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby 's growth hysterotomy performed in the third trimester , this is basically an abortive cesarean section \( c section \) the abortionist makes in an incision in the mother 's abdomen and removes the baby the baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse medical abortions these are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child common drugs used for medical abortions include mifepristone \( ru 486 \) mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy \( progesterone \) this lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby the tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug , misoprostol , causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb methotrexate this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby 's fast growing cells it also attacks the life support systems the baby needs to survive when the systems fail , the baby dies misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb salt poisoning this technique is used in the second and third trimester the abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother 's womb the needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby the baby breathes in , swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning , dehydration , brain hemorrhage and convulsions taking nearly an hour to die , the baby 's skin is completely burned , turns red and deteriorates the baby is in pain the entire time the mother goes into labor 24 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby prostaglandins used during the second and third trimester , prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac , causing violent premature labor during these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving chemical abortions these are abortions caused by drugs that , at least some of the time , prevent the implantation of the already created baby in the uterine lining some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly created children are the ortho evra birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins , which may inhibit ovulation , change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly formed human \( physicians' desk reference 60 ed montvale , nj thompson pdr 2006 2402 \) the nuvaring vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins , which may inhibit ovulation , change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly formed human \( pdr 2357 \) depo provera contraceptive injection , when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months , inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which , in turn , prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in

abortion,in your point of view it is okey to kill somebody just like you \? even though it is absolutely wrong ! it is unnormal and immoral to kill a baby,"even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion , i do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of bible verses and claims about what god wants or does n't want 1 if i somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else 's body as a host , then i absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life , especially if i an incapable of thought or choice this is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing , whether or not that living thing is a human if they did , i do n't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors 2 not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex also , the choice to have sex \( unprotected or not \) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term , in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment 3 i seriously doubt the validity of all those post abortion statistics , as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data however , even if they are true , it is not the government 's job to prevent people from making poor decisions if it was , then , alcohol , cigarettes , extreme sports , body modification , and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal sure , abortion could be safer , and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not but there are more than sob stories for post abortion women there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back",-1,+1,0

abortion,"it is a degradation to you , perhaps others believe differently why should we legislate based on your moral beliefs \? let 's face it , unmarried people have impulses , desires , etc they are going to act on it would n't you rather they have the tools to prevent pregnancy than not have them \? perhaps i should have been more specific in my example a baby grows inside of you so technically , it is a part of you a part of your body you are not obliged to see it to term if you choose not to this is why a ban on abortion would fail we should reduce the number of abortions because it 's a very heartbreaking decision for a woman to come to no woman comes to it lightly when someone decides to end the life inside her , it is because she knows that it is a better choice than condemning the chiild to a lifetime of unhappiness some come to it because they know they cannot overcome an addiction and thus cannot bring a healthy child to term others because they know they cannot financially support the child others because they live in abusive homes that they do n't want to subject a child to whatever the reason , it 's certainly not an easy choice to make so providing resources for these women such as education and contraception , can make a world of difference as for your last argument , what substantiates your claim \? from the university of california study on abstinence only and comprehensive sex education behavior research cannot make judgments about social values , but it can evaluate the success of school based curricula at producing tangible outcomes for young people the weight of the evidence from peer reviewed scientific journals clearly shows that some comprehensive sex education programs can reduce behavior that puts young people at risk of hiv , stis and unintended pregnancy , and that these programs do not promote earlier onset of sexual activity or an increased number of sexual partners among adolescents by contrast , little if any credible research exists to substantiate the claims that abstinence only programming leads to positive behavior change among youth the credible research sends a clear message to policy makers if the goal of school based sex education is to increase positive health outcomes for youth , comprehensive \( or abstinence plus \) sex education is the proven effective choice abstinence only programming runs the serious risk of leaving young people , especially those at elevated risk , uninformed and alienated","ok i agree about a new debate any ideas \? i do think i need to clarify something however and then i 'll leave it at that sex with in the context of a lifelong heterosexual marriage is the ideal and proper function of sex any form of sexuality outside of that is dysfunctional and causes problems as with anything when it is not used properly i raised the issues of porn , ted bundy , premarital sex , and the like as case studies of this principle all of these are sexual expression outside of the proper context of sex and all of them cause problems hence why i would classify them as dysfunctions what does all this have to do with the abortion question \? the fact that there is such a thing as this debate about abortion proves there is a problem no problem , no debate so here is the problem as i see it married couples do n't have abortions so who does then \? those expressing themselves sexually outside the context of marriage if this causes a problem \( abortion \) than we must say something is dysfunctional or unhealthy we ca n't say it is the sexual act because that alone does n't always cause problems it has to be the context in which it occurs because sexual expression in one way is without problems and in another it causes problems or to put it another way one is a healthy expression and the other is unhealthy so to sum it all up you will know whether something is healthy or dysfunctional by the fruit it produces all the examples i gave including abortion are symptomatic \( the fruit \) of an underlying problem sex outside it 's proper context but this does highlight a problem we in our culture suffer from we have forgotten the principle of sowing and reaping when you plant a tree you do n't immediately get fruit , it takes time so if we do something and do n't immediately see bad results that does n't mean there wo n't be any it may take years before are actions bear fruit so i hope you can see that i'm still debating the same issue i'm going after the cause and not the symptom however i also have been careful not to argue from religious reasons , although my convictions inform my reasons so i would agree with you that people are biologically programmed to sexual desires and that sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious , committed relationship but i would say , judging by the fruit , that there is a healthy and unhealthy expression of that sexuality maybe we could debate whether or not sex outside of marriage is unhealthy by looking at the fruit it produces",+1,-1,0
abortion,"abortion is going to happen its been going on forever people that are against it do so for moral reasons i completely understand , but you are failing to realize that it will happen regardless of the legality of the procedure and in some cases is completely warranted for example , what if your 14 year old daughter is raped and becomes pregnant does that not constitute a valid reason for the termination of a pregnancy what if you are going to give birth to a child with a severe birth defect or extreme retardation if it was n't for new advances in medicine these people would never survive anyway , so how is it any different \? it sounds harsh and heartless but it is reality none the less its like people that are against stem cell research because some of the stem cells come from aborted fetuses ok , you object on moral grounds , i get it but what if you 're paralyzed and the researchers say a dead baby will help you walk again are you really going to tell me that you 're not going to give the green light the child was aborted regardless of what decision you made , at least let the horrible process have some good that comes out of it","i was waiting for someone to bring up this point while some women may still have abortions , the abortion rate will definitely decrease by it is my guess about 90 or even more how many people would commit murder if it was legal , do you think \? obviously making something illegal is always a deterrent for a large amount of people that people will do it anyway is no argument to legalize something heinous by the same token , should we legalize rape now so that no rapist will have to do it in secret , or because he would do it otherwise anyway \? why should we abort a child because of mental retardation etc \? in the same way should we kill a person because they are mentally ill \? when you talk about horrible process what is more horrible being half awake whilst doctors are ripping your fetus out of you are giving birth to a life \? what if a woman dies from abortion \? you are talking as if carrying a pregnancy is more traumatic than doing an abortion we are against abortion because we are talking about a life and as one professional once said it seems that those who supports abortion are the ones that are already born if a person is raped then give the baby up for adoption there are other choices available do n't make it seem as if abortion is the only way out",+1,-1,0

you are comparing the two wrongly war is about protecting loved ones and sacrificing yourself even if i were to accept that the unborn baby is a person \( which is a view that i do not necessarily agree with , as i 've explained above \) , then the unborn baby is also well justified to sacrifice itself to save the mother from a life threatening illness ! well obviously you do n't think life is sacredyour pro abortion lol i'm glad you find the abortion debate as something fit for humour that just goes to show how frivolous you are what a hypocrite and , by the way , i do n't think human life is sacred and i do n't believe in the sanctity of human life if you think that life is sacred , then you , by logical deduction , should not be able to eat anything that has life \( i e animals and even vegetables and fruits \) its nine short monthsto do what is rightto allow something to live you are obviously ignoring the amount of suffering that the mother has to go through during the nine short months furthermore , you said allow something to live , right \? if the continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother , then hypocrites like you will not be allowing the mother to live if you encourage the mother to die in the place of the baby , are you doing what is right \? after conception it is a separate human being it is not as i have explained , the baby is not a human being within the first trimester furthermore , the unborn baby , no matter at any stage , is dependent on it 's mother completely for nutrition in other words , the baby is , technically speaking , a parasite the oxford english dictionary defines a parasite as biol an animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism \( technically called its host \) and draws its nutriment directly from it also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others , but not at their expense \( strictly called commensal or symbiotic \) also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance , as the cuckoo , the skua gull , etc thus , by definition , the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body at the expense of her own health how barbaric and cold is that \? which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not or whether it should be legal or not this is simply an appeal to emotion it should not matter whether the child will make it or not then , whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you pro choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision they do not promote abortion , simply the legalisation of abortion if you ca n't see the difference , then you 're an idiot abortion is premeditated killing and so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live if the mother 's life is threatened by the pregnancy , by not aborting the child , you are also premeditating the killing of the mother thus , by your standards , you face a paradox i am appalled by how people can call themselves pro life when they say that the mother 's life does n't matter as long as the baby is not aborted this is hypocrisy of the greatest degree most pro aborts say abortion is good becausethe child might have problemsmight grow up in povertymight face lives trials i am not a pro abort i am pro choice , as i have explained the difference so do n't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life so full of misery that they would be better off dead you are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery thus , you are attacking a straw man poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been allowed to survive face you said this again , not necessarily i support abortion only when a foetus ca n't be confidently said to lack rationality , autonomy and self consciousness now wait one minute here can a newborn baby do any of these \? no of course it does it has autonomy and self consciousness but then again , even if i agree with you , by saying that a newborn baby ca n't have such experiences , it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral thus , your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand are you telling me that you want abortion legal because the woman has a right to her own body the short answer is yes , but the long answer is no congratulations , you have proven that you at least have some level of intelligence","my argument is very simple by having sex , one acknowledges the possible repercussions of that act primarily being 1 \) being impregnated and 2 \) getting an std by having sex , one realizes it might end up ina pregnancy no form of protection is 100 effective so anyone having sex should be able to have the responsibility of having a child why should the irresponsibility of the patents result in the death of the fetus \?

abortion,"ok , here 's a very real issue of making adoption compulsory you must make the woman carry the child to full term for somebody else to have the baby this is while the woman may feel deeply offended embarrassed disadvantaged by the pregnancy , and her body is on the line ! ! ! !",the women should n't be having unprotected sex in the first place rape is an entirely different subject,+1,-1,0

abortion,"we waste resources all the time in this country plastic surgery that we currently do is no argument that we ought to continue it is far fewer resources to have an abortion than it is to have a child \( even if we are talking just about the medical costs of the two events , let alone the effect that an entire person has on the overall use and waste of resources \) if you want to represent prenatal care or the rearing of a child as a waste of resources , i 'll leave the untruth of that as self evident most people who are for abortion and have had abortions do not have sex indiscriminately , this culture of irresponsibility that you speak of is not really in existence , or if it is , it is very small i have a different hunch about these things than you , but i also suspect we can only contrast our opinions here sans any kind of statistical evidence saying that having an abortion is like encouraging sex and irresponsibility would be like saying fixing a bullet wound promotes the use of guns and shooting people i do n't think so a lot of people who are unfortunate enough to need an abortion and have one become very much responsible about their actions and necessary precautions to prevent further occurences i am not arguing against the small fraction of abortions that are medically necessary there are always exceptions but we need to be looking at the rule when making generalizations i think i am , considering that most abortions are not by necessity but by choice the father is important in the quation but the mother always trumps the father insofar as it is her body there is no legal basis to support the importance of a fathers right to protect his unborn child you cant force people without violating their sovereignty \( which i describe as the foundation of morality \) i could argue that a woman who willingly engages in the sort of sexual relations that commonly result in pregnancy should thereby confer certain legal rights to the father it 's the beginning of a shared responsibility so there should be shared commensurate rights if a woman can legally compel a man to be held responsible after birth , he should have some legal say prior to moral agency is obtained once a person develops the capacity for value this valuation is the basic condition for determining the rightness or wrongness of actions no disagreement from me there complex ethical generalizations \( a theoretically codified moral state of mind having explicit opinions \) is attained when people are older , but insofar as we ought to view the child as an agent for which morality is an issue this begins when consciousness is established to the contrary living beings that do n't meet your imaginary criteria , merit protection due to moral concerns for instance if i were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant , there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants are n't moral agents a person is not really a person untill they are conscious , otherwise we would have give severed hands moral worth as human beings the meaning of the word being in the term human being implies consciousness consciousness can be equated to value insofar as there is an implied quality to the state of being conscious once a person is conscious they have a sense of pain and pleasure and light and dark and touch and sound etc this has intrinsic subjective value even if one is incapable of expressing this value \( the basic conditions for valuation are established at the onset of consciousness \) having morality based reasons to protect a life form , does not depend on the life form in question being conscious even if you could give a logically sound explanation of what consciousness is","it is true that an 'is implies ought' argument is not valid with regards to plastic surgery with the plastic surgery part of my argument , although pointing out the current frivolity of its existence , i was hoping to emphasize the fact that resource use and waste has more to do with the economic demand , not the equitable distribution of resources in spite of the economics having a greater population will not reduce this problem , it will only amplify the numbers of people that have insufficient access \( a pro life world increases the overall suffering in the world because scarcity is increased you could think of this as a utilitarian point to make , though i am not a utilitarian \) population growth is the biggest reason why people go without , scarcity is defined in terms of population , ie if there were 100 people the notion of scarcity would be unreasonable i was not suggesting that prenatal care or the rearing of a child is necessarily a waste of resources the discussion was about resources and with a greater population there are thus less resources per person to be distributed , thus by adding more to our population such that it is continuing to grow , rather than meeting or being less than the replacement rate , creating greater desperation in any given population if you know anything about sociology you would understand that most of the desperation of scarcity effects children and young mothers \( abortion reduces this \) i was trying to say that the amount of resources that are used in raising a child are vastly greater than having an abortion abortion solves the problem of using more resources \( even though it does use some 500 700 dollars worth \) and the problem of over population \( not increasing it as much \) there would be more resources for less population thus the quality of life individually and society generally would increase the only way using resources on child rearing is a waste is if the people turn out badly and are a drain on society there are not enough resources have you ever read freakanomics \? if you have , you would know that there is a statistically significant link between crime rates and the incidences of abortions in this country i e 18 years after abortion was legalized and abortions were more frequent , crime rates took a precipitous decline in the mid to late 80 's \( not a point necessarily to justify abortions , just a point to demonstrate the link between crime and desperation and the population that are born into scarcity \) if abortions were clearly wrong i would not think they are justified even if they caused a decline in crime when you said that you are looking at the rule that i had described i was refering to the statistical likelihood that unwanted children tend to have unproductive lives , be criminals , be on welfare , have teen pregnancies , use drugs , etc when i said that the father is important you seemed to think that i was implying legal basis , but i was not , i am not sure why you argued against my statement there , i was thinking in terms of how the relationship ought to be considered you could argue that they confer legal rights to the father but wouldnt have any constitutional justification in doing so i agree that there are issues with a woman being able to hold a man responsible after birth even if he didnt want it , however rather than forcing her to have a child based on his rights , i think that there should be legal choice to abdicate rights after the birth of an unwanted child if i were to engineer a bacteria and release it into the atmosphere that is deadly to only one species of plant , there are are legitimate moral considerations involved even though plants are n't moral agents i dont know if the moral issue of your scenario has to do with the intrinsic value of the plants it is generally more to do with the extrinsic value of the plants being wiped out and the effect this has on the species that are worthy of moral consideration and the integrity of the biosphere that sustains complex life thus it gets back to the entities of intrinsic moral value human beings \( biologically human and agents which have attained consciousness \) , and i would also argue other morally aware species like dolphins and pigs and chimps but then you get into trans species ethics which is a different topic",+1,-1,0

for example , just imagine , you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception \? or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species \( ie sex \) \? you have no husband , your boyfriend said that it is your problem your family has no money to take care for your child and you even have n't finished a school yet what would you do \? consider birth control before i had sex now that it is too late , i would accept responsibility for my actions , or inaction as the case may be do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong \? no , i wouldnt want to end the life of the fetus because the fetus having been conceived are direct results of my irresponsibility in not using birth control or making the guy use it \( assuming we are not talking about an immaculate conception \) religious ethics based on the idea of sin or evil has no effect on my decision its about how i was raised what would i do in that situation \? of course , i would think a lot but if my situation was very very bad , i would have an abortion , i think of course , i would never forget about that and when i grew up and became an adult with a work , with a husband and with money i would adopt a child i can explain why having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire and you probably wont ever forget about that either , in fact , youll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control abortion is a murder murder is unlawful killing , abortion is legal therefore not unlawful , nor murder but everybody has a right to be wrong i dont think that its a right maybe a privilege everybody makes mistakes and we should n't afraid to make them we should fix our mistakes it is called a responsibility , if you do something wrong , fix it what about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes \? i agree that once a mistake is made , that one should fix it , but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion we should use this rule everywhere , as well with abortion so first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime \? where do we draw the line \? as i said earlier , abortion is a murder and how to fix a murder \? if you killed a child , give a life for another child it is a solution for that well no , not technically murder it is killing , but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity \? doing so may help you sleep at night , but does it really fix it \? how to fix other problems \? for example , if you stole 1000 , give somebody 1000 if you broke a tree , plant a new tree if you messed up a book in a library , apologize and buy them a new book and i said , if you killed someone , give a life for someone if a person steals , wouldnt it be fixing it to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from \? of course , if woman has capabilities to take care for the child , it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him one does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isnt able to be a good parent i am totally against abortion as a form of birth control when actions can be taken to prevent conception in the first place as for situations of rape or failed preventative birth control , i am pretty much indifferent about whether or not a woman want 's to be a mom or have an abortion i do n't care about abortion in as much as a person being responsible for their actions if people took more responsibility , then abortion would be less of an issue in the world","why not \? if you have an opinion on something , do you intend for it only to apply to you \? or to everyone \? if you think smoking is morally wrong , do you think it is wrong for you or for everyone if you think killing is morally wrong , do you think it is wrong for only you to do \? or for anyone to do \? no , of course each person has his own opinion , but most of people judge other people a lot of people who are against abortion really judge those who are for abortion but everybody has to have own opinion i have mine , as well as you have yours are we talking about an immaculate virgin conception \? or a 16 year old who mated with another of her species \( ie sex \) \? hey , there are a lot of teenagers who become pregnant i wrote it just as an example , because i know one girl who was in that situation consider birth control before i had sex now that it is too late , i would accept responsibility for my actions , or inaction as the case may be well , you would , but there are a lot of people who wouldnt accept responsibility as i said , i know someone who was in that situation , and it was really hard for her to make a choice having the baby and giving it up for an adoption is also an option if your financial support is dire and you probably wont ever forget about that either , in fact , youll probably think twice the next time you get horny and decide to have sex without birth control yes it is a good option , but it is very hard to give the baby up for adoption , when you gave a birth to him , when this little baby had been under your heart for 9 months also there could be any reasons why woman cannot be pregnant for this period it is not so easy to be pregnant alone \( if we are talking about that bad situation \) yes , people should think before having sex , but everybody makes mistakes and everybody solves their problems as they can somebody is strong enough to take a responsibility for the baby , but somebody cannot it is their choice \) murder is unlawful killing , abortion is legal therefore not unlawful , nor murder you confused me \) \) i didnt get you i didnt mean lawful , or unlawful i meant that by abortion people kill their babies i dont think that its a right maybe a privilege a privilege \? dont know i think that a privilege is something that is given to someone after doing something good everybody can be wrong do you agree with that \? we cannot live without mistakes it teaches us how to be better , by making mistakes we can understand what is right and what is wrong , or something like that what about taking the responsibility in preventing mistakes \? i agree that once a mistake is made , that one should fix it , but not taking responsibility for your previous irresponsible behavior does not fix anything in my opinion i agree with you , that we should take the responsibility in preventing mistakes but there could be different situations , when people cannot control them somebody are not wise enough , somebody doesnt think before doing something but life is intended for us to self perfection it is a life we learn from the mistakes of a lifetime somebody has to do his own mistakes to understand something , somebody can understand from the mistakes of others people are different that is why our life is very interesting \) so first time offenders of homicide should be acquitted of their crime \? where do we draw the line \? in our society it wouldnt be understandable if the offenders of homicide wouldnt be punished of course they should be punished but in my opinion they should be punished only be god but our society wouldnt accept it , and i understand why we are living in the world where some people should be punished like going to jail or something like that , because it is a good way for other people to live quietly so that offenders also can fix their mistakes after a jail , for example they are also people they just make more serious mistakes like murder , or something well no , not technically murder it is killing , but can you really fix killing someone or something by giving life to a completely different entity \? doing so may help you sleep at night , but does it really fixit \? i think it is in any case , it would be better then doing nothing , right \? the most important thing when you understand you mistakes of course , a person cannot give a life for exactly that person he killed \) it is impossible physically , but giving a life for somebody else is an answer too i think have you seen the film seven pounds with will smith \? this film describes what i am talking about very good he killed 7 people , and it was his mistake but after that he helped 7 other people i understood that abortion is not so bad after watching it if a person steals , wouldnt it be fixing it to give the money back to the person it was originally taken from \? yes , in my opinion , it is a best solution , but if for example the person from whom you stole is dead for example , you cannot give the money back to him in that case , you can give them to somebody who needs it may be for charity \? \) one does not necessarily need to be a capable parent to give birth giving a child to an adoption agency is an option if a woman isnt able to be a good parent yes , it is a good option , of course but there are several options to take responsibility for child and to bring him up yourself , to give him to an adoption agency , or to have an abortion \( there can be some other options , i dont know \) but each person should choose himself and to take responsibility for his actions and decisions if people took more responsibility , then abortion would be less of an issue in the world a agree with you but there are a lot of people who cannot take responsibility even for themselves , that is why we have a lot of options of course , i wouldnt have an abortion , because i love children and i want them , but i do not exclude it if i would in a situation i described earlier , i would do it but in other cases i wouldnt but abortion is not wrong abortion is an option option which is judged by someone , which is supported by someone , which is not understandable by someone , but a lot of women do it and they will do it in spite of other peoples opinions and that is their choice",+1,+1,1

after conception it is a separate human being it is not as i have explained , the baby is not a human being within the first trimester furthermore , the unborn baby , no matter at any stage , is dependent on it 's mother completely for nutrition in other words , the baby is , technically speaking , a parasite the oxford english dictionary defines a parasite as biol an animal or plant which lives in or upon another organism \( technically called its host \) and draws its nutriment directly from it also extended to animals or plants that live as tenants of others , but not at their expense \( strictly called commensal or symbiotic \) also to those which depend on others in various ways for sustenance , as the cuckoo , the skua gull , etc thus , by definition , the mother has the right to allow or disallow a parasite to receive nutrition from her body at the expense of her own health how barbaric and cold is that \? which has absolutely no bearing on whether abortion is moral or not or whether it should be legal or not this is simply an appeal to emotion it should not matter whether the child will make it or not then , whether or not the child is aborted or not should also not matter to you pro choice advocates are simply campaigning to legalise abortion and allow parents to make their own informed decision they do not promote abortion , simply the legalisation of abortion if you ca n't see the difference , then you 're an idiot abortion is premeditated killing and so is sacrificing the mother in order for the child to live if the mother 's life is threatened by the pregnancy , by not aborting the child , you are also premeditating the killing of the mother thus , by your standards , you face a paradox i am appalled by how people can call themselves pro life when they say that the mother 's life does n't matter as long as the baby is not aborted this is hypocrisy of the greatest degree most pro aborts say abortion is good becausethe child might have problemsmight grow up in povertymight face lives trials i am not a pro abort i am pro choice , as i have explained the difference so do n't use this excuse that abortion would save children from a life so full of misery that they would be better off dead you are using poverty as the epitome of suffering and misery thus , you are attacking a straw man poverty is nowhere near the suffering that some of these children who have been allowed to survive face you said this again , not necessarily i support abortion only when a foetus ca n't be confidently said to lack rationality , autonomy and self consciousness now wait one minute here can a newborn baby do any of these \? no of course it does it has autonomy and self consciousness but then again , even if i agree with you , by saying that a newborn baby ca n't have such experiences , it still has no bearing on whether abortion is moral or immoral thus , your statement here is irrelevant to the debate at hand are you telling me that you want abortion legal because the woman has a right to her own body the short answer is yes , but the long answer is no congratulations , you have proven that you at least have some level of intelligence","if the contraceptive fails by no fault of their own , then it is not their fault ! what \? of course it is their fault they chose to have sex they knew no protection or form of contraception is 10 effective if it fails , do n't blame the contraceptive they knew there was a chance that it could fail yet , knowing this and knowing the fact that they would not be prepared should it not work , they still had sex they put pleasure before the consequences and that is their failing that would be like blaming the haitians for the immense damage caused by the earthquake because they were irresponsible that is an awful analogy a better analogy would be if the haitians had placed thousands of tons of high explosives on the fault line and blew them up and were surprised there was an earthquake i have n't seen you challenge the definitions i have quoted , so i 'll assume you do n't have a problem with them the definition you gave was not a scientific definition yes , there are scientific definitions , but that is irrelevant because you chose to ignore them in favor of an inappropriate one was n't it you who told me in a personal message that one of the scenarios where you think abortion could be permitted is when the baby is grievously mentally challenged \?

abortion,"what \? ending a life is n't cruel \? so i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you these are the cruel methods stated again methods of termnation of pregnancy there are three abortion classificationssurgical abortion , medical abortion , and chemical abortion they are defined as follows surgical abortion these are abortions that involve an invasive procedure major types of surgical abortions include suction aspiration this is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy \( the first three months \) the abortionist inserts a suction tube \( similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end \) into the mother 's womb the suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle dilation and curettage \( d c \) in this procedure , the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall the baby 's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother 's womb dilation and extraction \( also known as d x or partial birth abortion \) used to kill babies well into the third trimester \( as late as 32 weeks old \) , the abortionist reaches into the mother 's womb , grabs the baby 's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother , except for the head the abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby 's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby 's skull the abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby 's brain out the forceps are then used to crush the baby 's head and the abortionist pulls the baby 's body out the rest of the way dilation and evacuation \( d e \) this form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester \( 24 weeks \) the abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby \( arms and legs \) and then tears the baby apart the baby 's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby 's growth hysterotomy performed in the third trimester , this is basically an abortive cesarean section \( c section \) the abortionist makes in an incision in the mother 's abdomen and removes the baby the baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse medical abortions these are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child common drugs used for medical abortions include mifepristone \( ru 486 \) mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy \( progesterone \) this lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby the tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug , misoprostol , causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb methotrexate this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby 's fast growing cells it also attacks the life support systems the baby needs to survive when the systems fail , the baby dies misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb salt poisoning this technique is used in the second and third trimester the abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother 's womb the needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby the baby breathes in , swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning , dehydration , brain hemorrhage and convulsions taking nearly an hour to die , the baby 's skin is completely burned , turns red and deteriorates the baby is in pain the entire time the mother goes into labor 24 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby prostaglandins used during the second and third trimester , prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac , causing violent premature labor during these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving chemical abortions these are abortions caused by drugs that , at least some of the time , prevent the implantation of the already created baby in the uterine lining some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly created children are the ortho evra birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins , which may inhibit ovulation , change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly formed human \( physicians' desk reference 60 ed montvale , nj thompson pdr 2006 2402 \) the nuvaring vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins , which may inhibit ovulation , change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly formed human \( pdr 2357 \) depo provera contraceptive injection , when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months , inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which , in turn , prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning these actions produce its contraceptive effect \( pdr 2620 \) plan b is

abortion,"i 'd like to take the time to address several tings that have been raised in this debate and clarify my argument against abortion first , the affect this debate has on women who have had abortions this reality has weighed heavily on my conscience but i think a greater issue is at stake here and therefore the cost is worth it the greater good that is being served here is the hope that abortion on demand might someday be ended and that the emotional trauma it causes to women will be ended also the holocaust of abortion will not be ended until people see and know the reality of what it is it has been stunning to see through the course of this debate the lengths people will go to so as to sugar coat this issue and make it appear not so bad and actually justifiable so my effort is to make that know as best i can but the truth is that when women , who have had abortions , come to a correct understanding of what has happened there is real pain and real quilt and that certainly is not to be dismissed so for those who have had abortions i say there is a way out of the pain and quilt true forgiveness is possible there is only one way out and that is through the great exchange god in christ takes your life and he gives you his when he died , you died and the charges against you are paid in full , the debt is canceled then the life of perfection he lived becomes yours it is laid to your account so you go from an infinity negative debt to an infinity positive righteousness and through his resurrection you are raised to newness of life this is only possible through repentance and faith confess your sins and trust god to do for you what he said he would in christ this faith is not a leap in the dark , like crossing your fingers it is an active trust , like standing on solid ground a confident expectation in the faithfulness of god with that said i would like to clarify my argument against abortion further and answer the question should abortion be banned but let me preface my argument with a disclaimer i realize there is a difference between proof and persuasion there is no argument that i can put forth that ca n't be disputed there are actually people who will argue for the reality of square circles so i put this argument forth for those who are truly open minded in hopes you will be persuaded the taking of the life of an innocent human being without proper justification is murder and murder is illegal abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification therefore it is murder and should be illegal","religion ca n't be your argument , since it hinges on what people believe and some believe in choice when you say women , you generalize and include all females , but some women , again , prefer a choice i 've said it plenty of times and i 'll say it again , a fetus before it can survive outside of the mother 's womb is a potential life , which is the same as an independent egg or sperm and anything else in between",-1,+1,0
abortion,"that scenario of the endangered mother is rare the vast majority of abortions are performed on healthy women and children you do n't make laws based on exceptions to the norm the right to life is the most fundamental right , everything else stands or falls on this one issue when we as a people deny that right to a whole class of people we have undercut ourselves in regards the taking of life i agree with you , but not when it comes to abortion and just to be clear , an unjustified action is unjust i'm convinced that an abortion is unjustified for the reasons commonly given in regards how far i think the constitution makes that clear , but roe vs wade undercuts that very constitution this is n't a debate about some theoretically fetus somewhere this is about the 1500 lives that are snuffed out daily in our land and it 's about you and i because it affects you and i do n't think laws like this can stand without serious ramifications just consider that 1 3 of our population has been exterminated since roe vs wade do you think that has an affect on social security now that there are more people drawing from it than paying into it what of the effects on health care \? how many doctors and scientist were exterminated","you do n't make laws based on exceptions to the norm maybe not based on , but exceptions to the norm should at times bear heavily during the legislative process the right to life is the most fundamental right , everything else stands or falls on this one issue so the argument is that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life , the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors \? if a teen girl was found pregnant she could be arrested for underage sex and could carry to term while incarcerated ready to be made into a movie jeez i think that in a very real sense , the right to reproductive privacy precedes the right to life i would love to read a response to this particular point in regards the taking of life i agree with you , but not when it comes to abortion yes i understand you are a firm proponent of the death penalty is n't it true \? oh right i remember the logic you do n't make laws based on exceptions to the norm you do n't have to convince me that high abortion rates represent the deepest poverty i need to be convinced that government intervention \( invasion to the privacy thereof \) in doctor pregnant woman relations is merited remember i think that the right to life depends on reproductive privacy",-1,+1,0

no fighting evil with evil is not evil , it is neutral there is only one truth , yes , but my point is that you do n't know what that one truth is human perception is the only thing we can run on because it is the only way we can see things you ca n't , i ca n't therefore , you cannot make assumptions of what the truth is by putting in place of it your opinions my abortion belief is not opinionated in any way , and that 's what separates me from you it 's a radical thing to say abortion is wrong under any circumstance because the idea that it is takes away freedom from certain people is taking away freedom right when people do n't all share you ideas \? no and yes , there is a gray area in pedophilia you ding dong have you no imagination \? here 's a scenario you are an adult , and you make great friends with a teenager one day , you fall in love with him her and they feel mutually back despite you being much older then them is that love wrong \? just because there is an age gap \? not necessarily not all pedophiles are evil perverts just because you think they are what hitler did was wrong , did i dispute that it was n't \? but in fact , it was gray in some areas why \? because he saved germany he did more evil then good , but in the end , he still was some gray despite being a lot of evil the 9 11 bombers were wrong to , but you have to realize , they were brought up in a third world country where they had nothing , where they starved to death whilst people like american 's were getting hundreds of divorces every day yes , they killed people , but they suffered and died for their actions even in those acts , there was balance , despite being mostly evil it 's meant to be contradictory i do n't believe in either radical , i trust in the balance between the two which i explained why are you arguing as if i believe in both of them at the same time \? i'm not pro choice , i'm just on this side of the debate the fact is that a fetus is n't human at a certain stage and completely human after a certain point just because we judge does n't mean we know i know facts when i speak of my abortion ideas , but i do not know facts when i make opinions of you you 're right , you do n't need anyone to tell you right from wrong , but neither do i , because i do n't have opinions about this , i know facts about this that 's what i base my morality on i do n't care what the dictionary says use your own definition for a human being what separates humans from most animals is that we have a self aware consciousness , a soul some animals also do , but not all , but that does n't mean we are n't still defined by our personality , consciousness , and soul just because something is alive does n't mean it 's alive like a human a mushroom is alive is is it wrong to step on a mushroom \? no , it has no consciousness a severed chicken leg has living cells \( for a time after being severed \) , is it wrong to cook and eat it \? no it has no consciousness what about a human finger \? is it by itself human because it has living cells \( for a time \) \? no to say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy yes , humanity is measured by consciousness you think the mentally retarded have no consciousness \? they do they feel and think and have a soul people in commas are sleeping for a long time they think and feel and have a soul vegetable people are not human they brains are dead they feel nothing , think nothing , and have no soul only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going they are vegetables are vegetables people \? no the person they were died with their brains so yes , vegetable people are soulless piece of meat i know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness we have machines to tell this what you do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness also , yes , i am god i am a pantheist but that has nothing to do with this debate if humanists mention souls , then apparently i'm not a humanist duh no , i am not a butcher , but anyone can be a butcher if they want the point is that masses of meat are n't human , dummy just because it 's made of human cells does n't make it human just because something is unconscious does n't mean it does n't have a consciousness so no , i am not being unscientific at all , nor grotesque and insane you 're insane for mincing my words together and taking everything i say in a manner that it does not mean abortion to purify races is n't right if that 's the intent but the act of the abortion at a stage before consciousness is n't wrong , the intent is wrong stem cell research is very beneficial for medical research though , killing a conscious fetus and selling it 's body parts is immoral and disgusting that intent is wrong in some cases , but only the intent , not if the act of the abortion is before the fetus is conscious once again , the intent is wrong , but the act of aborting before the fetus is conscious is n't i'm all over on what \? abortion is right when the fetus is n't a human once it 's human , it 's wrong what 's complicated about that \? i know when a fetus is human , i can prove it you ca n't prove that fetus is human before it has a consciousness yes , i do , you do not need to provide a link no , i did not say that , i gave it as an example of one of the extreme points i 've already said 3 or 4 times that i do not agree with either extreme point , i'm just on this side out of coincidence , and now because you 're zealously pro life no , my comments are morally logical and make plenty of sense what you thought my comments said by mincing the words together inside your mind is what makes no sense what is wrong with you \?","somepeople do not agree with what is evil we are disagreeing with abortion here i see it as evil , you see it as a good where is the gray area \? and rape in your opinion it is wrong but what about other cultures \? and hitler , he killed those who thought inferior and weak murder has always existed but peoples opinions differ on whether the murders are warrented there are those who think our participation in the me wars were wrong that they served no good others disagree so evil is in the eye of the beholder so when you say fight evil with evil its subjective , because people might not agree which side is right and which side is wrong yet you say there is only one truth how do you determine what is truth on your own \? and should everyone be subjected to your way of thinking \? it is not radical to say something is wrong and stop calling me names you look foolish your example is sick you fall in love with a child \? \? \? \? a child is a child and it is never right to have sex with a child if you are an adult there are laws to prevent this from happening to keep children safe from your way of thinking love can destroy people , families and communities you said , just because we judge does n't mean we know i know facts when i speak of my abortion ideas , but i do not know facts when i make opinions of you facts about abortion \? i doubt that what facts do you know just curious you 're right , you do n't need anyone to tell you right from wrong , but neither do i , because i do n't have opinions about this , i know facts about this that 's what i base my morality on the fact is that which is growing in the womb is a human being the abortionist goal is to kill that which is growing that is a biological fact so if you base your morality on facts why are you pro abortion \? that speaks volumes about how you come up with what is moral and what is not you yourself think you are god so in your mind , sex with children could be a good thing , cheating , lying and stealing could also be moral even child abuse i find it sad that in your post you defend evil where is the balance in that \? yes , humanity is measured by consciousness for people who live godless lives it might for people who do not consider all human life sacred for those who are moral relativists it might i find it sad that you eliminate groups of people who are living but unconscious that they lose the right to live while in this state people who are in comas , under for surgeries even sleeping is a form of being unconscious so because a child is in the womb does not mean they are not aware of what is going on especially physically when i was pregnant i used to push in on my baby and prode it until it moved aware of my touch your view on life is sad vegetable people are nothing \? you are so so cold i feel sad for you really , that your worldview imo of course is so empty that you would compare a living person to meat what a cold way of putting it",+1,-1,0
abortion,"no my dear you do not obviously know the law our government says the child belongs to her , that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy without any confirmation from him he does not even have to know , even if he is the father if he was recognized as a player the law would not be what it is today nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either that is the law the fact is , the baby is hers at conception she took the risk the sperm leaves his body and enters her his part is done the sperm was a gift , he certainly cant ask for it back can he \? lol she holds the cards and has him by the you know what that is if he wants the baby , because whether he wants it or not its not an issue of course i am a christian and do n't believe it should be this way , but that is the law today i believe personally that the man should be considered that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion like i said today she can kill and he need not even know it i talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs you said its unfair why \? you are trying to make yourself feel better look better you are pro choice and believe the option should be there remember consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing you said , it 's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful christian you are ! why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore the man is just as responsible for pregnancy he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant your opinion is sexist is so many levels am i calling names \? didnt you call me a pig \? better reread that section am i insulting you because you are pro abortion \? well gee i am sorry , the truth hurts you said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonthat abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it now if the way i described it sounds crasssorry , but i was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made most abortions happen on unwed women women mainly who profess to be christian in fact that does not change the fact how they got pregnant why dont you describe it for us in more politically correct terms \? it still wont change the truth of how it happened as i said again the man is an onlooker so says the law that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in is that better way to put it \? you are absolutely unbelievable you want to blameand blame you do , for what is a womans issue , so says the law what do you not get \? dont you have the guts to call it like it is \? if the man is accountable wouldnt he have a decision in the pregnancy \? no the government says no he is not an issue and he is not responsible as for condemning anyone for an abortionthis discussion is not about that i work with women who have had abortions because i know what its like , i had one i was one of those women who spread her legs it was my call , my responsibility and the pain and agony i suffered was on me as it should be so dont tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through the work i do is in this field , i see the pain , especially afterwards and guess what the pain is just not experienced by the woman , but by the boyfriends , the husbands the children the woman calls the shots as i did when i had mine some thirty years ago i would give anything to be able to take that day backand i know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way you are pro choice whether you want to believe it or notbecause you simply condone others the right to kill were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into hitlers ovens pro life \? how about those people that owned slaves \? would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one \? and do you have to use the f bomb in order to debate \? is it an effective way to get your point across \? of course you will retaliateyou condone abortion which is violence you ranted onyou are a vile , horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this how dare you say i contribute to abortion if a woman asked me if she should have an abortion i 'd say 'it 's up to you , it 's your choice' i would n't judge her , i would n't influence her opinion if someone is considering an abortion than they are n't anti abortion anyway and pro abortionists existing wo n't mean diddly squat to their decision i was making an analogy that you simply did not like well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute \? how about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull \? if someone drives someone to a robbery and they are caught does the police just say ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye \? i mean come on if you refused to take her to the abortion , she might not get it if the doctor didnt show up , the nurse refuse to do itthe baby might have a chance you said , yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion , hence i think it 's okay before then pain has everything to do with it , if death was n't painful people would n't be so scared of it i do n't have to be entirely pro abortion just like i would n't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance i would like if my daughter was starving i 'd steal food for her without a second thought again thanks for the insult , what a wonderful christian you are you can act self righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people , demeaning them and being downright rude not to mention you lie very godly youre so ridiculous its not even funny bolongamany people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it not just because of pain insult \? retaliation , isnt that what its all about , you said so yourself didnt you \? then you judge me when you think i retaliate why are you judging me from different standards than you live by \? lol oh yes because i am a christian , right am i supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup , not stand up for the things that are unchristian \? no case for abortion can be made scripturally christ would want me to stand up the his little children , he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin , devastated my life until i came to him so you dont like how i put things christ said , they hated me first and will hate you as well i am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth you might be the greatest person in the world , but you are pro abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice you are not for and against you are for because you think it should be legal you said , is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it 's money \? you 're wrong , having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing , his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is if you 're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you 're obviously very wrong i said , if a woman and man are marriedhe cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion he has no rights even though it is his child but he would be held legally responsible for child support if he did not want the child and wanted her to get an abortion she calls the shots now if they were not married , she cant hold him financially accountable for anything the baby is hers , unless she puts his name on the birth certificateand in that case he might for forced to pay you said , what \? a date i randomly made up \? no the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands and the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science , i linked you the information but it 's clear you obviously do n't read half of what people try to say to you which is where i get my opinion on when i think abortion is okay well you are wrong again http en wikipedia org wiki james elgin gill 128 days early or 21 weeks 5 days early then there was amillia taylor who is also often cited as the most premature baby she was born on 24 october 2006 in miami , florida , at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation at birth she was 9 inches \( 23 cm \) long and weighed 10 ounces \( 283 grams \) she suffered digestive and respiratory problems , together with a brain hemorrhage she was discharged from the baptist children 's hospital on 20 february 2007 there are babies like this all over the world being born my niece was born 23 weeks 4 days she spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old she weighed just over 1 pound i know the information out thereyou need to get educated and read a bit more , instead of just google and posting pain is not an issue personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all if i had no worth for the womb why would i have a child \? you value your own child and do n't care about another in the womb \? \? \? \? \? yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks , right \?","our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married even if they are married it 's the woman 's decision still so this has no validity well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds in this case i believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it , it would go to him no , no , no if he is considered on all grounds then if he wants and abortion and she does n't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead and you want to compare your use of the noun pigto the descriptions i have used \? do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective \? you also called me a sissy \? sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people it 's not an adjective brush up on your english language it makes no difference if i said you 're like a smelly tramp it 's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp how old are you really , are you even an adult \? what i stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible i'm a fully fledged adult it is not the truth it 's your opinion and i'm arrogant yet your feelings have to be the truth \? and why are you bringing religion into this all these humanists bringing religion into debateswhen i have not yay another list for me to make things you have said religiously to back your opinion he was supportive but of course our faiths in god are different , because when i became christs , but if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion but we are a secular country that has turned its face from godand it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws but i love christ more than any other person in the world and i have faith in him more than i have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life i believe that i will not know if any family does not make it heaven is perfect and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved i ca n't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this you have a filthy mouth and it demeans your postsand makes you look like you have no class no , a swear word is a word it means nothing oh look another insult to me why thank you very much and i'm not 'classy' it 's not something i can aspire to with all my tattoos ! your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror hitler and sangers and i could add a few more for that matter but will leave it with these two i think a few re reads are in order here read their opinion and read mine it 's not even comparible why dont you do some heavy research on thisnot just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google \? your position is heartless , cold , and you like i said are ignorant of the facts my education is nursing i am going into midwifrey i can assure i need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion my opinion is what you think is heartless and cold to many others it is acceptable and logic do n't speak for the world your pro abort position makes for champion killing , not life i'm not pro abortion is should be considered as a last resort and if the last resort is an abortion then i accept that i do n't champion killing , i do n't tell anyone to abort and i do n't abort myself i just understand why people do why \? is biology sexist \? the truth is the truth it seeks no sides we have hashed this over and over and you will never get it im afraid the man does not have to assume squatunless he is married and the courts order him to pay biology is n't sexist again i study it the context in which you describe things is sexist the truth is what you perceive it to be the truth is never what you think yes he does if i had a child unmarried knew the father but we were n't a couple he would still have to pay child support they both have sex blah blah and as i said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again so who takes the big risk \? my fiance and i were n't married he took responsibility he admits he took the risk even though i was on contraception stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion not true i state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence you champion killing so you dont want to see the evidence no you do n't you 've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which i'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious i post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates i use my evidence you use yours why does it matter \? not true , go educate yourself , not going to do it for you bugger \? boy have not heard that one since kindergarten because my opinion differs to yours i'm uneducated \? no , i have educated myself and come to a conclusion you have come to a conclusion i'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it 's an opinion that 's the difference between you and i , i can accept that my opinion is n't right for everyone you 're a forcer , you think that everyone has to share your opinion or they 're a bad person and educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in england why on earth would you of all people be sorry \? mind boggling to say the least so because i believe woman have the right to abortion i no longer have feelings i feel empathy and sympathy , it 's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences stop word twisting my kind of story is the one pp does not want out there , because they want abortion pictures in the best way it 's funny you 'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim i want abortion to be seen positively consistence in the key in debating something you clearly do n't have tell mehave you ever in your entire life made a mistake \? did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didnt believe that way all along \? are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors \? what \? we cant change our minds about issues , feelings \? must be nice to be perfect well my position on abortion changed and i am allowed to change my mind are you \? yes and yes i never denied this fact so i guess i 'll just answer the first two questions you can change your mind all you like it 's no concern to me and i never claimed it to be i'm allowed to change my mind , i probably wo n't on this topic though what youre saying here is that i do not have the right to change my mind , i dont have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion \? you are the one who is judgemental and arrogant but then youre perfect remember \? no i'm not i'm saying do n't judge people on actions you have taken yourself again i'm aware of the consequences of abortion are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted \? explain to me exactly when i have judged someone and acted arrogantly \? thanks for calling me perfect all the time i do n't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason when you make a huge mistake if you have children dont you want to protect them , teach them what might hurt them \? i protect my child and i will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e c t but i'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset i wo n't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up a lot of things hurt people you ca n't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize if my daughter was ever pregnant i 'd help her if she asks for the pros and cons i will tell her if she asks me what to do i will say 'darling , whatever you feel is best for you' why \? because her happiness is the most important thing to me well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing and looked the other way in a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down everyone participatedgood should have overcome evil , but didnt people stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared and people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice they did n't let jews get gassed everyone participated \? that 's a wild claim to make most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that oh my goodness dont i was not a child when i had it did i say you were \? i am a wonderful person most of the time , not perfect like you but i am ok and i'm arrogant stop calling me perfect , i'm blushing i have raised two wonderful , happy and successful children , am a grandmother to two little girls , have been married over thirty years to the same man and have a blessed life great i have a wonderful child to this means nothing to the debate subject and being with same man is n't an accomplishment it 's a choice i am the luckiest person in the world the baby i aborted was my husbands a pregnancy at that time would have been hard you aborted but have the right to tell other woman they ca n't \? or that they 're like hitler \? that they are murderers \? come off your high horse distraught about what \? having an abortion , derp how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible , not a fairy lala trip then go against what your morals tell you is wrong \? it is a horrible experience my morals do n't tell me it 's wrong in all circumstances abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible have you ever seen one \? anyone who does not see one and think its horrendousanyone who does not see one and think its horrendousis cold , compassionless and empty abortion is horrible , i 've seen many \( the nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true \) it 's not cold , uncompassionate and empty you yourself said it 's emotionless how can it be empty then \? i'm a bad person even though i assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth \? do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save \? and because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers \? what is upsetting about it \? and who says the kids are young \? of course abortion is upsetting for a child the word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age \? i thought that was common knowledge i told my kids when they were teenagers its not selfishits real life and it happens so they were n't children kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television what makes abortion different you tell me \? abortion of a sibling effects someone personally watching south park does n't lol i do not feel i called you names i described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with well i listed the names so you if you do n't believe fact that is your ignorance of course i have problem with racism you are pro abortion period , end of story you want to deceive yourself into thinking youre not but you are you condone what that video i wanted you to watchshows thats what you think should be legal you do not stand up for all life no you think i am pro abortion i know i'm not i am neutral if anything i do n't deceive myself into anything , you want to believe i am so you can preach even if i was it does n't make my opinion wrong and yours right i stand up for life especially those already born i stand up for a woman 's life and her choice to abort for a start i am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good i no you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours because you do n't like my opinion you assume i am an awful person you condone murder i never called you a racist you said i had the same opinion as hitler and margaret who are racist so yes you did i am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good i am bold , and i do state the facts in ways people feel offended but i think down inside they are offended because what i say exposes them , gets them thinking about what they think is ok and you think abortion is ok and you are judging me no you 're not you are trying to warp my opinion and claim i am a bad person because of it your opinion is not right to everyone just because you believe something does n't make it the truth you just offend people by dismissing anything they say you have n't exposed me my opinion is the same and your debates do n't make me even think about changing it i never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion i point out what you say that are untruths they 're not untruths , you believe they are just because you do n't agree does n't make them wrong why do you quote a book you dont believe in \? not once have i quoted the bible perhaps say when \? did n't think you could you are a pro abort and you champion abortion period live with it accept the label take it as your own again your opinion is not fact you think i am pro abort it does n't make it true i am not however handing my posts in to be graded so i could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation i work i live a full life and when i get on here i slam it out the fastest way i can if i had to hand in an article or paper it would be correct great , i study work and have a 8 month old i still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly you have provided however little evidence , more lies just like the lie about the earliest born preemie i showed you your error i work in this field and i know i have n't lied once you constantly lie , i pointed out every lie all my scientific evidence i have posted with my debate i do n't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will i work in this field idiot nurse midwife mean anything to you \? this is your worldviewand explains what i said all alongwhy you are pro abortion the lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart i feel sorry for you actually it does n't explain anything i said i value people i just do n't love them unless they are my family or friends i ca n't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me i certainly would never love you worldwide love is mostly a religious belief since i have no belief in religion i feel what i feel is right do n't feel sorry for me i'm so happy and fulfilled with my life am i preaching \? what is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what i am doing \? do you ever look in a mirror \? huge difference i have n't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong you tell me i am heartless a murderer , cold , ignorant i accept my opinion is n't fact you ca n't do that you place no actual evidence just your opinion your opinion is not fact you said two things in your postyou are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain lol ever heard of reading \? it will do your argument good they feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester \( around 12 weeks \) and i think abortion should happen before that honestly , you liar , i said what about 30 times \? 24 week abortions are wrong so is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain or 24 weeks when obviously it cant lol you do not even know your own position that is why you look silly and have to swear do you even know when the fetus can feel pain \? lol nawyou dont yes it is 12 14 weeks like i said all along what the hell are you talking about \? i said all along abortions should n't be allowed at 24 weeks i know my position i swear because i want to i like swearing it 's as much as the human language as any other word yes i know when the fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester , again i 've said that all along",-1,+1,0
abortion,"in my point of view , abortion should n't be banned abortion is a not bad thing for women , especially for teenagers everybody thinks that abortion is wrong , but most of those people even have n't been pregnant it is easier to talk about it and to say that women should n't have an abortion , but when it happens it is very hard to make a choice when people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong , they judge women who had an abortion we cannot judge people abortion is not very good , of course but it is not wrong it is a choice it is a choice of those women who cannot take responsibility for children because of some reasons for example , just imagine , you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant you have no husband , your boyfriend said that it is your problem your family has no money to take care for your child and you even have n't finished a school yet what would you do \? do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong \? i do n't think so you would think , even for a minute you would think about abortion what would i do in that situation \? of course , i would think a lot but if my situation was very very bad , i would have an abortion , i think of course , i would never forget about that and when i grew up and became an adult with a work , with a husband and with money i would adopt a child i can explain why abortion is a murder i agree with that but everybody has a right to be wrong everybody makes mistakes and we should n't afraid to make them we should fix our mistakes it is called a responsibility , if you do something wrong , fix it we should use this rule everywhere , as well with abortion as i said earlier , abortion is a murder and how to fix a murder \? if you killed a child , give a life for another child it is a solution for that how to fix other problems \? for example , if you stole 1000 , give somebody 1000 if you broke a tree , plant a new tree if you messed up a book in a library , apologize and buy them a new book and i said , if you killed someone , give a life for someone so , i can say that all of us make mistakes , we are not perfect nobody does but we have to think without emotions and to fix our mistakes of course , if woman has capabilities to take care for the child , it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him but if woman decided not to have a child , it is not wrong it is not good , but not wrong","right and wrong cannot be simply measured on some sort of scale , no amount of good deeds wipes out a single sin even something as simple as telling a lie , which is not on a level with abortion",+1,-1,0

gayRights,"thanks for making my point your argument is a good example of trying to define marriage you said marriage is a contract it may be true that most marriages have some form of a contract but that is just a formality and not the marriage a contract defines the parameters of something that exist independent of the contract it does n't make the thing see this is were we get into trouble , when we try to define the nature of something because the nature of the object is defined by itself , not the subject for example lets say i wanted to define you and i said ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply no i'm not , i'm a see i would do better in describing you as you actually are so it is with marriage , we need to describe it as it actually is , not what we think it is and historically speaking marriage has almost always been seen has the joining of male and female for procreation which leads us to the next question when two people want to have a contract with each other , why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners \? in the case of marriage it 's because they normally produce kids why does that matter to the state \? consider the following report http www healthymarriageinfo org docs costofdivorce pdf so yes , this type of relationship is of serious concern for government and they would be wise to do everything they can to support and encourage it and primarily because marriages produce the next generation you said the human spirit should be without bonds this pernicious little lie has been the root of all kinds of human evil , not to mention the question of this debate people doing what ever they want without restraint is anarchy and detrimental to society , it 's why we have laws if we are going to flourish some restraint is necessary but let me ask you , what is more creative and productive , the undisciplined mind or the disciplined mind \? before you respond let me remind you of your education that allows you to read and write , with out which you could n't have this debate final thought you said do n't make it an issue of orientation because the end result is the same effect heterosexual couples typically reproduce and homosexual couples never do how is that the same effect and how does this avoid being a contradiction since you say a is the same as non a","see this is were we get into trouble , when we try to define the nature of something because the nature of the object is defined by itself , not the subject this is true , but while the nature of an object may be objective , the definition of a word is very much a matter for the subject for example lets say i wanted to define you and i said ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply no i'm not , i'm a see i would do better in describing you as you actually are so it is with marriage , we need to describe it as it actually is , not what we think it is you 're conflating defining and describing an object is described , while a word is defined for an object , it is possible to ascertain by inspection whether or not a given description matches the object for a word , however , it is necessary to establish the word 's definition as an axiomthere is no manner in which is can be deduced what you 're doing here is describing a specific marriage \( or collection of marriages possibly even every marriage you 've ever encountered \) as a joining of male and female for procreation and then turning around and declaring that this must be the definition of marriage but that is no more a valid conclusion than describing a specific animal \( or collection of animals possibly even every animal you 've ever encountered \) as a large , greyish thing with a trunk and then trying to use that as the definition of animal in fact the most we can say is that if the description is accurate \( ie , if the collection of animals are in fact large , greyish things with trunks \) , then the description establishes a subset of things which are animals similarly , given that there are marriages which can be described as a joining of male and female for procreation , then the most we can say is that this description establishes a subset of things which are marriages in and of itself this does not rule out the possibility of other things which are marriages now , one is perfectly free to subjectively restrict their definitions to the subset under consideration , as an axiom , but there is nothing intrinsic to the subset which requires this , and nothing which forces others to agree with what amounts to an entirely arbitrary decision on your part all that you 've done in choosing that particular subset is declare that anything else is n't a marriage by your definition , which reveals the debate for what it \( like so many others \) really isan argument over whether your arbitrary definition is somehow less arbitrary than anyone else 's definition",-1,+1,0

if you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals , how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens \? when we read history textbooks , it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society if this such society existed , homosexuality is wrong let 's break down your arguments p1 in a society with only female homosexuals , society cannot grow with no future citizens p2 history is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society ergo c homosexuality is wrong response to premise 1 first , why does it have to be only female homosexuals \? second , you are misconstruing society and population according to the oed , society refers to association with one 's fellow men , esp in a friendly or intimate manner companionship or fellowship on the other hand , population refers to a totality of objects or individuals under consideration , of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it so , while homosexuality might not increase the population size , this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance , which you lack response to premise 2 it is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow furthermore , i 've shown that society can grow with homosexuality , so your second premiss makes no sense and therefore , since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong , your argument is illogical and hence holds no water if a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation , that spell problems for the society one problem is the fear that all of society 's resources is going to be used up resources share a help in sustaining society growth wood , fire , paper , food , etc if homosexuality existed in that civilization , then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met in this case , homosexuality is right i have no quarrel with your argument here except for the last part there is no conclusive evidence to show that with homosexuality , overpopulation will not occur as i have shown , your definition of overpopulation is flawed again i repeat , i am well learned in geography and demography , so do n't fuck around with definitions and pretend to be knowledgeable in front of me we can have homosexuality , but if each couple still gives birth to 20 children , overpopulation might still occur furthermore , it does not mean that if we allow homosexuals to marry , then everyone will turn homosexual there still will be heterosexuals and in fact , there wo n't be any change as to the number of heterosexuals since homosexuals will probably not marry someone of the opposite gender anyway when i review both contradicting statments individually , they are both truthful a person can be both right and wrong at the same time i have shown that both your arguments are fallacious you are wrong on both arguments at the same time if i murdered adolf hitler , im wrong for taking a life however , im right for saving the jewish people from cruel torment you have asserted to claims without evidence first , how are you wrong for taking the life of hitler \? and second , where is the proof that hitler is the source of most of the suffering of the jewish people \? i believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person a rapist cannot try to rape a person he has already rape d a person that is an incredibly stupid statement to make however , i am also right for saving a life committing murder is not a characteristic of rapists look at china they feared of overpopulation therefore , they proposed the one child policy the one child policy was introduced due to an abnormally high rate of population growth after the era of mao zedong , who preached that with more people there will be greater economic progress the primary reason for the one child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth while it might or might not be due to overpopulation , it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in china relative to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in china i know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar but it does share similarities huh \? what were you smoking when you said this \? the policy states , basically , that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child also , there are exemption to rural married couples wrong that is only after the revision of the policy the original policy only said all couples were allowed to have one child did you know that there were on average 33 forced abortions a day at the peak of the enforcement of the one child policy \?

gayRights,"as i stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented first result on google the first country to allow same sex couples to enter into legally recognized marriage was the netherlands , effective in 2001 since then , six other countries and seven u s states have followed suit , though voters in california revoked it through passage of proposition 8 i would n't call that unprecedented if you are going to make a strong claim such as something has never been practiced , you should be sure you actually know what you are talking about therefore as i said using traditional marriage as an argument against same sex marriage is just like using traditional marriage as an argument against interracial marriage and your argument about language was really just wordy , vacuous , pseudo intellectual babble words and language change over time this is a natural phenomenon cultures are not stagnant marriage used to be between a man and the women he bought essentially society changes this does not equate to a destruction of language what proponents of the phrase gay marriage demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words and they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority you mean , just like interracial marriage \? if you ca n't see the comparison , i'm really sorry even at their peak , the nazis never had a majority of political affiliation , they took power as a political minority , but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority ! yes because the lgbt movement trying to gain civil rights is exactly like the nazi regime i do n't think you read 1984 very carefully if you think anything in it can be applied to being against same sex marriage and i find no logical pathway for how same sex marriage could lead to a state of total decay and ruin that 's some class a fear mongering right there do you work for nom \?","addressing your first point , of course there are modern developements in calling legally recognized relationships between same sex couples marriage , that is why it is worth debating , whereas as little as ten or twenty years ago it was not i was speaking in the broad scope of human history , and in that great span , this misapplication of the more traditional term of marriage to some form of relationship between a couple who are of the same sex is new and is unprecedented , particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word marriage on everybody else against their consent in the name of equality and liberty for all i assure you words do have meaning , and pondering that meaning is neither vacuous or pseoudo intellectual some of the greatest intellectuals of western civilization are on my side on this one descarte , aristotle , newton , poets like shakespeare , and thoreau \( who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way \) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used and we have benefited greatly from them of course the meaning of words change over time , but the underlying reality does not some words are reaplied to have new meaning , but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature the same bird is called by different names in different languages and while some words may change faster than others , changing the word does not change the bird any culture that values its heritage will naturally want to defend that culture from uncontrolled change including its own language , and it is natural and good that it should do this it is the practice of a form of social self preservation this may sound academic , but it is not ! it is exactly what is practiced by the government in french canadia they censor and conrol their printed media , street signs , and advertising billboards so as to assure adherence to the standard french language in word use and spelling this may seem outlandish to the provintial mind , but begs the question why do they do it \? because they value their own culture i do not venture to put myself on the side of government cencorship of all printed media , but surely our american society if it values its own cultural heritage at all , must atleast protect its language within the confines of the written law if sufficient demand for civil unions passes the standard of civil debate and law , that is fine but no equivelant forum exists for the passage of redefining the meaning of words unlike in french canadia , there are no language police as law is nothing but the accumulation of words , the manipulation and steady curruption of those words will lead to the destruction of those laws original meaning , either in word , or in practice as those ignorant of the past will be unable to understand the true meaning of the words as they were intended this is not hypothetical the spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered aztec subject 's written histories and records for a reason , to bring about the destruction of their civilization as for interracial marriage , i have already addressed that issue , please read the previous post more carefully my 1984 reference was about the ministry of truth , which systematically corrupted the language by deminishing the number of words and broadening each remaining words application , thereby diluting its meaning the speaker posits this is exaclty what is occuring in the case of legal use of the term gay marriage , for the reasons stated in the primary statement this speaker did not state that same sex marriage could lead to 'a state of total decay and ruin ' the inner statement was taken out of context , see previous argument neither has this speaker sought to discredit same sex unions , either in principle or in law the speaker wishes to make clear the distinction between using the word marriage in the traditional sense and in the new same sex sense in which it is being applied proponents of the use of language of so called gay marriage would have you believe there is no difference between the two definitions , while simultaneously insisting that their new definition be accepted which is a contradiction",+1,-1,0

that 's called tyranny do you support tyranny \? what if it was n't in your favor \? what if those judges said gays should be burned \? that 's why there are checks and balances i think the real problem here comes to two points that will always divide this arguement 1 \) you believe homosexuality is like race something someone is born with and has no control over the opposing side believes it is action realted , because someone is not gay , somone is living a gay lifestyle the problem is a word symantics one if you define gay as attracted to members of the same sex , than it 's a moot point , because that person is not limited in any way but if being gay is having a relationship with a member of the same sex , than it has become an action , and thus is not afforded any special protection because it is action oriented all of this is moot in my opinion because no matter what you still have all the same rights as straight people , but your arguement rests on it entirely 2 \) marrying whomever you love is a basic right this just is n't true if it was , than what about pedophiles studies show many of them are born with these feelings what about serial killers \?

gayRights,but you are operating under a simplistic view of evolution for your argument you even seemed to show your ignorance of the difference between a mechanism for evolution \( natural selection \) and the theory of evolution itself we 're not entirely certain if or how natural selection works on humans being sentient beings seems to mess with the dynamic a bit,"before i begin , the following reminder is in order in biology , evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next these changes are caused by a combination of three main processes variation , reproduction , and natural selection http en wikipedia org wiki evolution i suppose your reply is an attempt to rebut my assertions bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species and consequently has damned the homosexual , for the homosexual does n't propagate its species and that your reply is in favor of homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly , however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings in fact , the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population , must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole in addition , studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual the problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective evolution works on helping the individual survive , however in those organisms that reproduce sexually , species evolve in groups therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on there is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics , but the possibility is a strong one my response consider the consequences of supporting the oppositions argument if homosexuality is a consequence of evolution and such a consequence is for the purpose of the survival of a species how does homosexuality benefit the survival of a group of its species \? we can immediately infer that evolution has removed the homosexual from genetically contributing to its own species and thus , the genetics of the homosexual are not conducive to the survival of the species , but are destructive of the survival of the species therefore , the answer to the question is evolution excludes certain individuals from genetic contribution to its species through homosexuality for the survival of the group for the survival of the species furthermore , evolution has eliminated certain genetic consequences from genetically multiplying with members of its own species we can also infer that all groups of species are beneficiaries of the homosexuality of the individuals of their group is the author implying that in order for sexual reproduction to propagate the species more effectively , certain individuals must be homosexual so that others will not be homosexual \? the author invalidly reasons in fact , the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the \( human \) population , must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole either the author is attempting to insult the intelligence of the audience of this debate or is guilty of granting that which is unreasonable \( i dont think the author intentionally does either one , but unintentionally accomplishes both \) if we were to reason according to the example by the author we can arrive at some very interesting conclusions for example the prevalence of inbreeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that inbreeding among a portion of the \( human \) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole the prevalence of cannibalism in other species makes it fairly obvious that cannibalism among a portion of the \( human \) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole the prevalence of random breeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that random breeding among a portion of the \( human \) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole the prevalence of vomit consumption in other species makes it fairly obvious that the consumption of vomit among a portion of the \( human \) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole the prevalence of butt licking in other species makes it fairly obvious that butt licking among a portion of the \( human \) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole just because certain things are true of many other species doesnt allow any man or woman to validly infer the same is true of another species this is called in layman terms jumping to conclusions if you were to reread and carefully consider the assertions of my original argument as re posted above , you will see that the assertions are subjective on the behalf of the proponents of evolution the propositions only indicate the inescapable conclusions that the theory supports i did not assert that the theory of evolution accounts for all that is known of the processes of lifes continuity nor did i suggest one should embrace the theory i have simplistically explained some of the consequences of some of the supposed complexity of the theory of evolution and by doing such , i have demonstrated that wherein i reference evolution , i can reduce the supposed complexity of that subject of the theory of evolution to its simple illogical conclusions and for this reason i am not troubled by an accusation that i view evolution simplistically \( albeit , my argument is particular , yet i was accused of an universal argument \) another issue that i must address , before i am accused of neglecting it , is the matter of social contributions made by homosexuals , both tangible and intellectual whether a homosexual or any other person has made any tangible or intellectual contribution that enabled s the survival of a species is purely fallacious speculations of what one person has or has not done that conclusively contributed to the survival or destruction of a species are of the fallacy , argumentum ad speculum we can indefinitely speculate by hypothetical reasoning that which may have been or should have been yet , until there is conclusive evidence that would lend itself to the scrutiny of sound reasoning that concludes that any member , or group of any species is a necessary cause or consequence of for the survival or death of a species , we should not speculate that it is obvious can we speculate that we would be ignorant of the law of gravity if kepler and newton were never born \? can we speculate that we are alive today because of that knowledge \? yes , we can speculate about anything , but we cannot rationally speculate unto a definitive conclusion that is reasonably useful one last thing before i end this rebuttal my rebuttals explain the wherefore of my propositions your rebuttals on the other hand evidence nothing that supports your argument your arguments seem to always come in the form of either a straw man , ad hominem , or red herring fallacy in fact , there is no argument in your rebuttals you simply assert whatever you think is ad populum a little advice if you are unwillingly to take the time to support your case , i suggest that you forego rebutting the arguments of someone who will take the time however , i welcome your legitimate attempts to support your views that are contrary or contradictory to my arguments",+1,-1,0

\( leviticus 15 19 27 \) enlighten me jake , explain to my why the story of genesis is not also symbolic , even though every scientific discovery of the last hundred years has proven it to be false when taken literally i believe procreation to be sacred and should only be within the marriage of a man and a woman , anything other is wrong because it distorts from the family which is also eternal and sacred finally a legitimate response now we can have an actual discussion are you also for making divorce , premarital sex , adultery , and masturbation illegal as well \? do they not also help to defeat the sanctity of marriage and family \? how do you feel about those studies which that being raised by parents of the same sex has no ill effects on the child \? those same studies show that what tends to hurt children is only having one parent , or in the case of orphans no parents would you rather orphans had no parents then two parents of the same sex \? here is my main question if you do not deny that homosexuals are born gay , then why would god make them as he did why would god intentionally put them in a situation where , if they want to love someone romantically \( as a husband loves a wife \) , they are sinning what kind of a cruel god would do that \? jake , clearly homosexuals want to have sex almost everyone does you also are of the opinion that having sex outside of marriage is a sin why then , would you want to stop homosexuals from making their love and actions more moral \?

\( or in this case , marry \) let me ask you this have we not all loved our our same sex friends as much as we 've loved the opposite sex \? i have loved my friends as much , sometimes more than a mate \( after all , the opposite sex is oh so confusing at times ! \) but the difference is we do not desire to have sex with them ahatherein lies the heart of the controversy over homosexuality , and homosexual marriages you see the truth is , it 's not about love it is about sex , and who these people desire to love , is who they desire to have sex with i can already hear everyone saying , so what \? ! of course people want to have sex with whomever they love but no sex has been perverted and removed from its original design first we love , then we marry , then we consummate our marriage \( it is just the icing \) and the marriage \( the love \) is preserved through commitment before god again , i hear folks saying well that 's what homosexuals want to do ! first , we must understand that love begins with god so many people misread and misuse scripture and quote jesus as saying , in regard to what the highest commandments are , to love thy neighbor as thyself for their arguments but note that jesus says , commandments plural immediately proceeding love thy neighbor as thyself he says the first and greatest commandment is you shall love thy lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind following is the second greatest commandment love thy neighbor as thyself so if homosexuals reject god 's teachings on love and marriage and sex , how then can they use the argument that 'they just want to be able to love whomever they want' \? they actually want to have sex with whomever they want , otherwise they would just remain the best of friends , you see \? that is not the same and then , they want to take it a step further , and sanctify it in holy marriage this is re writing the bible to suit their own desires which is strictly forbidden people may love whomever they want they just ca n't have sex with whomever they want well , actually they canthere is free will some say they were born this way i say that in some cases this is actually true in many cases it is a choice but let 's say they were born that way there are alcoholics and depressed persons and naturally promiscuous persons and all kinds of burdens passed on in birththis is what 's called our cross to bare sometimes we have to make the choice to sacrifice an urge or desire to sin and in turn use this struggle for the good of all or we can succumb to it and let the consequences fall where they may but i 'd say 98 of our population has some sort of dilemma to struggle with like all other tribulations , it must be offered to god for his guidance on how best to use it and the american government has made separation of church and state very clear they must , therefore , be consistent the government has no right to redefine marriage in its holy context if they stepped in and redefined marriage , a whole bunch of other decisions they 've made concerning separation of church and state \( removing the flag from classrooms , the commandments from courthouses , etc \) would then have to be reversed they ca n't have it both ways , and they know this peace","there are 2 shot and simple points to be made firstly , is that there is no need to run a country based on religion , this happened in saudi arabia and look at the crime , injustice and autocracy there , quite simply we should run a nation based on what the majority deem to be acceptable , in the case of my country , the uk , gay marriage is acceptable , murder and rape are not secondly , people do not choose to be gay , scientific evidence shows that people are born gay , would you not allow a person with dyslexia or downs syndrome to marry \?

when we read history textbooks , it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society if this such society existed , homosexuality is wrong scenario 2 if a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation , that spell problems for the society one problem is the fear that all of society 's resources is going to be used up resources share a help in sustaining society growth wood , fire , paper , food , etc if homosexuality existed in that civilization , then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met in this case , homosexuality is right when i say homosexuality is wrong and right i do n't mean that they are totally wrong and totally right they share a right and wrong like non homosexual people like any normal person when i review both contradicting statments individually , they are both truthful a person can be both right and wrong at the same time if i murdered adolf hitler , im wrong for taking a life however , im right for saving the jewish people from cruel torment though , i do n't really know about that if taking down hitler would stop the jewish people from suffering there were many factors that led to their safety i believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person if i killed that rapists , i killed a person i am thus , wrong however , i am also right for saving a life look at china they feared of overpopulation therefore , they proposed the one child policy i think that acts like a homosexuality act where couples ca n't produce more than one child i know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar but it does share similarities the policy states , basically , that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child also , there are exemption to rural married couples \( source wikipedia \) http www prb org articles 2006 chinasconcernoverpopulationagingandheal th aspx the link i provide is interesting because this show that china is now fearing of having too fewer children to support due to the fast againstof its people","no , i do n't treat your criticism as a joke i never did and thus , you are judging me wrong so why did you add lol in front of an already illogical comment \?

when we read history textbooks , it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society if this such society existed , homosexuality is wrong scenario 2 if a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation , that spell problems for the society one problem is the fear that all of society 's resources is going to be used up resources share a help in sustaining society growth wood , fire , paper , food , etc if homosexuality existed in that civilization , then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met in this case , homosexuality is right when i say homosexuality is wrong and right i do n't mean that they are totally wrong and totally right they share a right and wrong like non homosexual people like any normal person when i review both contradicting statments individually , they are both truthful a person can be both right and wrong at the same time if i murdered adolf hitler , im wrong for taking a life however , im right for saving the jewish people from cruel torment though , i do n't really know about that if taking down hitler would stop the jewish people from suffering there were many factors that led to their safety i believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person if i killed that rapists , i killed a person i am thus , wrong however , i am also right for saving a life look at china they feared of overpopulation therefore , they proposed the one child policy i think that acts like a homosexuality act where couples ca n't produce more than one child i know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar but it does share similarities the policy states , basically , that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child also , there are exemption to rural married couples \( source wikipedia \) http www prb org articles 2006 chinasconcernoverpopulationagingandheal th aspx the link i provide is interesting because this show that china is now fearing of having too fewer children to support due to the fast againstof its people","you did n't even show how my scenarios can be wrong in proving how homosexuality can be benenficial \( in scenario 2 \) and not beneficial \( in scenario 1 \) i have shown your scenarios to be wrong taken from my previous comment let 's break down your arguments p1 in a society with only female homosexuals , society cannot grow with no future citizens p2 history is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society ergo c homosexuality is wrong response to premise 1 first , why does it have to be only female homosexuals \? second , you are misconstruing society and population according to the oed , society refers to association with one 's fellow men , esp in a friendly or intimate manner companionship or fellowship on the other hand , population refers to a totality of objects or individuals under consideration , of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it so , while homosexuality might not increase the population size , this has no bearing on whether society will grow or not society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance , which you lack response to premise 2 it is a hasty generalisation to say that all societies have the desire to conquer and grow furthermore , i 've shown that society can grow with homosexuality , so your second premiss makes no sense and therefore , since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong , your argument is illogical and hence holds no water",-1,+1,0

gayRights,"well spoken , yet i cannot agree with you in your conclusion you state that there is an aspect of choice there are a few ways i can interpret your second sentence \( in the conclusion \) here is mine , individuals of homosexual orientation can become progenitors by choice , but must do this by an act that goes against their sexual orientation thus , their sexual orientation is against that of a progenitor and since progenitors are what create life and that very creation of life is a consequence of sexual reproduction , parenthood is formed now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what i called maintenance is what i'm directly interested in yes , parenthood is , in part , the result of progenitors , but it is also very much so the raising and the nurturing aspect as well when adoption is going to take place the progenitor parent s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child in that aspect , they give up their rights to parenthood you state that parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction , which i do not disagree , but another aspect of parenthood is the raising and nurturing having the ability to raise or nurture or both does not have reference to sexual orientation since this is the most important aspect to parenthood then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent perhaps they are n't the progenitors , but are fully capable of parenting thus , any human can posses the abilities to parent because of this a homosexual couple can posses the abilities to parent and thus have a right to be offered the option of adoption","yes , you have rightly understood the conclusion of my recent argument with which you do not agree next , you stated in the second paragraph , now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what i called maintenance is what i'm directly interested in my response the premise posits that the term parenthood has , many definitions it also , propositionally , establishes that the argument is based upon multiple definitions of the same term \( this is a non discreet way of using the fallacy of ambiguity to argue through to an ambiguous conclusion \) the introduction of ambiguity into a debate is nothing more than an attempt to redefine the key term s of the debate to prove a predetermined a conclusion and moreover , the explicit claim that more than one definition will be used for the same term invalidates the entirety of the argument however , disregarding what your intent may or may not be , i will continue with my rebuttal of the remainder of your argument wherein we disagree you stated when adoption is going to take place the progenitor parent s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child in that aspect , they give up their rights to parenthood my response if what you claim is true then lets test the principle of that proposition by application of the principle the principle when a man or woman no longer wants to be responsible for that which is theirs , they no longer have rights to that which is theirs \( lucidly stated for the debate \) a a husband and wife decide they want to get rid of their house they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the house b a husband and wife decide to offer up their car for free they no longer have a right to choose whom takes the car c a husband and wife decide to give up their animal pets they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the pets all three examples contradict the reality of the transfer of ownership albeit , a thief is more likely to agree with the examples than the common person for the thief presumes it is now his her property for the taking all parents have the natural law of authority of ownership and must first transfer that authority unto another party before another party can rightfully claim the same authority over the respective property whether it is of children , vehicles , houses , or pets lets move on to the next statement you claimed since this , \( to raise or nurture \) , is the most important aspect to parenthood then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent my response children of the age 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , demonstrate that it is possible for them to possess a nurturing or raising nature therefore they are possible targets to be parents individuals who suffer from diseases of the mind also meet the same criteria should they too be allowed to adopt \? pedophiles exactly meet the criteria should they be allowed to adopt \? the most hardened criminals meet the criteria should they be allowed to adopt \? the ultimate conclusion , logically deduced from my arguments , is that no man , woman , or institution has authority to determine the recipient of the transfer of authority of that which is not theirs to begin with , including myself no one in the world has a right to adopt no institution in the world has a right to adopt for if we argue that some have a right to adopt then we must reason that they have authority to steal that which belongs to another person a homosexual has no right to adopt however , the sister of a homosexual has the authority to transfer authority of her child to her homosexual sibling no right is necessary and the friend of the sister has no right to determine the recipient of the authority therefore , no gay has a right to adopt which is the actual question of the debate",+1,-1,0

gayRights,"thanks for making my point your argument is a good example of trying to define marriage you said marriage is a contract it may be true that most marriages have some form of a contract but that is just a formality and not the marriage a contract defines the parameters of something that exist independent of the contract it does n't make the thing see this is were we get into trouble , when we try to define the nature of something because the nature of the object is defined by itself , not the subject for example lets say i wanted to define you and i said ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply no i'm not , i'm a see i would do better in describing you as you actually are so it is with marriage , we need to describe it as it actually is , not what we think it is and historically speaking marriage has almost always been seen has the joining of male and female for procreation which leads us to the next question when two people want to have a contract with each other , why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners \? in the case of marriage it 's because they normally produce kids why does that matter to the state \? consider the following report http www healthymarriageinfo org docs costofdivorce pdf so yes , this type of relationship is of serious concern for government and they would be wise to do everything they can to support and encourage it and primarily because marriages produce the next generation you said the human spirit should be without bonds this pernicious little lie has been the root of all kinds of human evil , not to mention the question of this debate people doing what ever they want without restraint is anarchy and detrimental to society , it 's why we have laws if we are going to flourish some restraint is necessary but let me ask you , what is more creative and productive , the undisciplined mind or the disciplined mind \? before you respond let me remind you of your education that allows you to read and write , with out which you could n't have this debate final thought you said do n't make it an issue of orientation because the end result is the same effect heterosexual couples typically reproduce and homosexual couples never do how is that the same effect and how does this avoid being a contradiction since you say a is the same as non a","in the case of marriage it 's because they normally produce kids marriage normally does n't produce children sex does , specifically why does that matter to the state \? consider the following report the report in the pdf file only argues the importance of the institution of marriage to the general welfare of the population it says absolutely nothing about same sex coupling or marriage and it would seem like a good idea to promote the act to increase the influence of marriage throughout the population question would you make illegal couples that are infertile \?",-1,+1,0

gayRights,"except there is no such thing as a separation of church and state , so your entire argument is moot if there were this separation , then the federal government would n't be allowed to enforce their laws on churches , like telling churches they 're not allowed to talk about politics and yet the federal government does punish churches from talking about politics of course , the moment something religious enters into public territory , the federal government wastes no time in condemning it like the hypocrites that they are my point , though , is that separation of church and state is nowhere in any of our founding documents nowhere it is a myth when the constitution was ratified , many states had their own established religions and none of the founders had any problem with this they approved of established state religions ! the first amendment merely says that congress cannot establish any religion congress deals with federal laws , not state laws so it is the federal government that cannot establish a nationwide religion states , however , can the tenth amendment says that anything not talked about elsewhere in the constitution is up to the states this means gay marriage , for one thing meaning that a federal ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional but so is a federal law allowing gay marriage gay marriage is not in the constitution , so it is up to each individual state to decide i do find it interesting , though , that you 're a christian and yet you support something that the founder of your religion did not support jesus 'd be proud","but what you are missing in my opinion , is that even if the constitution does not have a specific reference to separation of church and state , does that really make it okay to completely ignore that idea \? if we just blindly followed everything the constitution says , would n't we still have prohibition of alcohol , and would n't it be up to the states whether or not women and minorities not have the right to vote \? those were all changed in amendments and i personally would support an amendment specifying a separation of church and state what you talk about , people enforcing that churches do not talk about politics , i have never heard that before , but if it 's true , the solution is not to say that because they can do that , you can ban gay marriage , the solution is to day that you should not be able to ban gay marriage and they can not enforce churches to not talk about politics you 're moving in the complete wrong direction , not in the right one without a separation of church and state , you get a government that influences its people or even forces its people to do things against their own religion i think you deeply do not understand the phrase separation of church and state it does not mean that one can not make references to politics or the state in church as you seem to imply , or even that one can not make references to the church in public funded buildings what it means is that publicly funded things like schools , and any kind of government facility including courthouses , can not express support for , or utilize public prayers , or anything similar regarding religion , and yes that includes atheism a separation is not state sponsored atheism , as they are also not allowed to show support for a disbelief in god a separation of church and state simply means that they can not coerce the people or force them into any kind of religion i think that your desire to ban gay marriage is what 's really wrong and unconstitutional here if a gay christian wants to marry his partner , is it not a violation of the free exercise clause of the constitution to not allow him to do so , that is , if you really believe marriage is a religious institution \? my main point as a libertarian , is that marriage is simply voluntary human relations as long as it 's voluntary , you have no right to step in on people 's personal lives and tell them how to live their own life",-1,+1,0

\) is n't going to happen here on earth so we do the best we can with a democracy that guarantees protection of religion your second point i know for a fact that some people do choose to be gay as one of my friends is newly gay , but did n't used to be , but after one too many hurts by the opposite sex and a desperate need to be cared for decided to give the other side a try \( and it should be noted that we hear each other 's views on the subject with respect and agree to disagree but are still good friends \) there 's also the perfect illustration of choosing in bisexuals , who ca n't seem to choose which sex they prefer it is a choice in the end , even if it 's an inclination one is born with , as i said in my original argument i do n't even begin to know how you came to compare gay marriage to allowing someone with dyslexia to marry \? re read my original argument about the necessity of marriage being male female marriage is a holy union between a man and a womanit is not a civil union \( although many treat it as such \) and that is why so many people have a problem with legalizing gay marriage it would erode the foundation and meaning of marriage according to god , which is sacred to believers you do n't want to believe in godhey , that 's between you and him and every human being has that free choiceno one is forcing or condemning anyone all that believers are doing is defending their faith based , holy sacraments so that others ca n't redefine them when they do n't even believe in them i mean there really is a contradiction there , right \? christians do n't marry for financial reasons \( at least they 're not supposed to \) or things like thatit is to pledge the marriage to god , to request his blessing let me ask you something what 's wrong with homosexuality being a choice \? i mean , if homosexuals are confident and proud of their sexual preference , why the need to say that the trait is inborn \? why all the shame \? fundamentalism is defined as a strong adherence to any set of beliefs in the face of criticism and unpopularity i am by no means a perfect christian , but i am trying to be an authentic christian and not a casual one , so i guess if that makes me a fundamentalist , then i guess i am \? but be careful about labeling when you so clearly and fundamentally adhere to your own beliefs diversity goes both ways my friend \) oh , and prop 8 , was voted down by a democracy , not by religionthe majority deemed it not to be acceptable , to use your own words","wow so much ignorance and hypocrisy to address i personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in christ running the country would be just and free of crime , pain , suffering , etcetera please observe the middle ages that is probably an ideal time for christians gays were killed no science blasphemers were killed almost everyone was christian but i would hardly call it a time free of crime , pain , and suffering no one cares what you say your friends said that he thinks there are so many possible errors in that statement it is mind boggling a \) your friend does n't know why he is gay and is trying to come up with a reason b \) your friend lied to you c \) you lied to us being homosexual is not a choice regardless of the fact that it has been proven not to be as you are clearly ignoring that , why would anyone choose a lifestyle in which they experience intolerance just to sin and piss of god \? you guys really need to learn logic marriage by the government is not a holy union in a church it is and that is what you guys fail to realize no one is arguing that marriages in churches should be between same sex couples , you guys can do whatever your magic book tells you however , according to the establishment clause of the united states constitution , we cannot base our government off of religion if we base marriage off of religion , how do we choose which one , maybe my religion says nobody can get married \? even if everyone in the country in christian , which thankfully they are n't , we still cannot use the bible as justification for public policy , it is not legal you can mince words all you want , but christianity is a religion and atheism is not and proposition 8 was passed by a campaign of fear mongering and large influence by the church of jesus christ and latter day saints that 's totally irrelevant , however , because it does n't matter how many people vote for something if it is unconstitutional you do n't seem to be very knowledgeable about the constitution so let me help you our system is not set up by majority rules it is set up by majority rules with minority rights the minority rights is not an afterthought it is at least as important the framers of the constitution specifically set up the government to avoid the kind of religious and tyrannical persecution they experienced in england",-1,+1,0

gayRights,"all homosexuals , male or female , who would adopt a child , are acting in a manner that is contrary to the nature and consequences of homosexuality for by reason of their supposed natural , sexual orientation , as they call it , their actions negate the possibility of becoming progenitors as a consequence moreover , the homosexual nature also axiomatically negates the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors as parents as well as negating the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors to place their well being as secondary and a childs primary however , before they have attempted to adopt a child , all homosexuals have already , in life , demonstrated the predispositional consequences of their sexual orientation which evidence the fact that they cannot put the well being of anyone before their own subjective well being for dont all homosexuals act contrary to the heterosexuality of their parents from which , as a consequence , they were born into this world \? moreover , do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families \? so it should be understood that any homosexual male or female who wants to adopt a child is both , acting contrary to his her sexuality , and is attempting to make the well being of a child secondary for homosexuals who want to adopt a child are choosing to do so for themselves and never because a child wants to be raised by homosexual males or females in conclusion if adoption is acceptable in a society , the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives and never the public or an institution for neither the public nor any institution can be held accountable for sorry decisions that ill affect a child whereas a parent who gives up its child for adoption must live with the consequences of that decision and will therefore choose as wisely as is possible in a manner that agrees with the nature of the parent homosexual males and females refuse to be parents and therefore no rational person ought to give their child to a person who is incapable of acting against his or own nature","the progenitors give up their authority to the child the second they give it up for adoption i'm sorry to say that your conclusion is flawed in that regard if you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and give it up for adoption , you lose all rights to that child hence the term give him her up for adoption you must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution i must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality",-1,+1,0

nature on an objective level is everything , and if we only do things in the name of nature than whats with all this technology , buildings , and artificial crap we humans have laying around \? saying something is unnatural is as convincing as saying something is bad people do n't know how trite the word nature really is , nature can be defigned as anything therefore banning marriage for two people because you deem it unnatural is discrimination , and prejudice as homosexuals can never produce children and or have a procreative type relationship , then it is not discrimination as we bar them this right through nature you can argue that we have the capabilities of sex in order to reproduce however i do n't see how homosexuality is hurting nature , and even though they ca n't do what through sex what sex is naturally there for , they 're desires and needs are still natural and therefore is natural for them to pursue it marriage in culture is usually viewed as a male and a female children as marriage is a large part of this culture , banning ssm is popular to common marriage stereotypes \( 7 , 8 \) yes to an extent , that is the first thing we think of when we think of marriage because marriage is about love and since heterosexuality is the norm , then when we think about love we automatically associate it with men and women marriage is in culture more seen as a loving commitment , therefore if two people love each other , then is n't them marrying just part of the culture \? further more for it to be in discriminating in effect is must be a right , as discrimination to a privilege is just how can you believe that two people loving each other is not a right but something we just let them do \? we are not allowed to love whoever we want \? as you must prove in the states eyes they deserve this ritual legal right then my argument on rights is void , if you cannot prove in the states eyes they deserve this then you have lost i do agree that right or wrong in society is vague therefore we need to have it legalized in order for it to be allowed but that is only because we ca n't simply say that whatever does n't harm anyone else is allowed and does harm others is not allowed because what harms or does n't harm is subjective , therefore we created the political system we have in order to try and sort out all of the issues and together decide what is harmful and what is n't illegalizing the right to love someone is discriminatory due to the fact that they are n't harming anyone , our government is not perfect and if people say that homosexuality is a problem then it will be treated like one , but it is not",-1,+1,0

because they value their own culture i do not venture to put myself on the side of government cencorship of all printed media , but surely our american society if it values its own cultural heritage at all , must atleast protect its language within the confines of the written law if sufficient demand for civil unions passes the standard of civil debate and law , that is fine but no equivelant forum exists for the passage of redefining the meaning of words unlike in french canadia , there are no language police as law is nothing but the accumulation of words , the manipulation and steady curruption of those words will lead to the destruction of those laws original meaning , either in word , or in practice as those ignorant of the past will be unable to understand the true meaning of the words as they were intended this is not hypothetical the spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered aztec subject 's written histories and records for a reason , to bring about the destruction of their civilization as for interracial marriage , i have already addressed that issue , please read the previous post more carefully my 1984 reference was about the ministry of truth , which systematically corrupted the language by deminishing the number of words and broadening each remaining words application , thereby diluting its meaning the speaker posits this is exaclty what is occuring in the case of legal use of the term gay marriage , for the reasons stated in the primary statement this speaker did not state that same sex marriage could lead to 'a state of total decay and ruin ' the inner statement was taken out of context , see previous argument neither has this speaker sought to discredit same sex unions , either in principle or in law the speaker wishes to make clear the distinction between using the word marriage in the traditional sense and in the new same sex sense in which it is being applied proponents of the use of language of so called gay marriage would have you believe there is no difference between the two definitions , while simultaneously insisting that their new definition be accepted which is a contradiction","that is astounding you managed to use so many words to say so little you were an english major were n't you \?

no there are times when tolerance is justified and times when it is not you assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent no , i do n't but i think there are important similarities both skin color and sexual orientation are things that are part of ones identity they cannot be changed neither makes a person inferior discrimination on the basis of either is logically unsound please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone again they are not the same , just similar but saying homosexuality is a behavior is being intentionally misleading it 's like saying shouting is just a behavior and therefore people should repress their anger at all times it 's completely impractical and utterly disconnected from reality you would n't say it 's a good thing \? i was referring to homosexuality , not gay marriage being gay is neither good nor bad , it 's neutral gay marriage , on the other hand , is good , because it shows acceptance of behavior for which we should be showing acceptance yes , just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives oh , wow , that 's a pretty hardcore view how is homosexuality anywhere near as bad as theft or murder \? all i see is two people having sex no harm done some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good agreed but gay sex is not one of them just ask the roman empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed hahaha you 're a funny guy telling people the are born gay and ca n't change kills hope for someones who 's conscience is troubled well , they are born gay and they ca n't change , so that 's just telling them the truth why should their conscience be troubled \?

who are you \? who are they \? i can find just as many people \( more probably \) who disagree with you who says your morals are better than theirs \? ok i do agree with you here morality can be subject to opinion but in the universal declaration of human rights it does say all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status it is only because of the time when this was written that it does not state sexuality as it was written in 1948 and homosexuality has only become legal in most countries since the 70 's again , says who \? all of these rights and guaranteed freedoms are nice to talk about , but they just do n't exist see first right from declaration ok i agree again with you that the specifics are vague and do not include marriage , in countries where gay marriage is legal those people have their rights yes this is actually what i mean when i said the argument had degraded the descent into name calling was very immature most of my very best friends are gay and i take real offense to comments like these it was because of the name calling that i got involved in the first place , as i have said before it is everyones right to religious beliefs and i believe that if they want to go about celebrating their beliefs then that is ok too , where it stops being ok is when they try to use their scriptures to affect laws in secular societies by demonising homosexuals and trying to change the attitudes of the people i also have gay friends and family and i coming from a strict roman catholic house have witnessed the devastating effect these beliefs can have on a persons mentality and general well being , there is a friend of the family that was beaten so badly for being gay that he had to move away no , i'm using the logic of something you believe to be wrong to show you how religious people feel did you know that many religions believe homosexual acts are only one step down from murder \? there is no logic in the equation as the two are far from equal , murder robs people of their dignity , right to life and robs families of loved ones and causes nothing but pain it is a heinous act homosexuality creates no victim or pain or loss of dignity , etc many religions believe god destroys whole cities if they permit homosexuality but more importantly , this is an attempt to put you in their shoes and show one reason why they have a right to vote to make homosexual marriage illegal many people do n't and religious people are entitled to vote just the same as everyone else , it would be that if they kept to this right and not infringe on the rights of others that their case could be respectfully considered i can empathize with people from a religious community , i was one as a child , my own mother would rather die than give up her beliefs they have a right to vote their conscious , and it has everything to do with religion do you have a right to force your morality on them and have their tax dollars support something they find to be a crime next to murder \? again i agree with you on the rights of everyone to vote i have no right to force my morality on anyone , i am not trying to do that what i was trying to get across was the fact that not all is known and what is known is constantly being questioned , religious texts can be interpreted to anyones avail , and it is proved that they are massively edited , the problem comes when secular societies and religious communities clash surely if no one is being hurt then there should be no problem , if religious people believe it is wrong then they should consider the fact that a civil union is not a religious one , and therefore void in the eyes of their creator as for the fear that god destroys cities that permit homosexuality , i believe you are referring to sodom and gomorrah , did god not remove his faithful from these cities before destroying them and did he not pledge that he would never again curse the ground on account of man after noah 's flood so there is nothing to fear",-1,+1,0

the word marriage has a religious aspect to it actually , i would contend that this is a very widespread misconception marriage is actually just a social arrangement many religions have tenets related to marriage , but marriage can exist completely outside of religion the government doesnt \( and shouldnt \) use any religions rules as the arbiter of what is acceptable in terms of marriage \( we do not have laws requiring dowery , or that fathers of wifes who could not prove their virginity pay the husband 50 sheckles , or that wives obey their husband as if he is god , etc \) we take our morals and our common sense and our constitution and some to a consensus on what should be legal e g we allow divorce for more than just adultery because we found practical cases for divorce other than adultery \( spousal abuse , etc \) anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so the right to be treated equally under the law is already being denied equality isnt being denied because people are talking about it it is certainly the opposite if you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different , think again equality under law is more than just a piece of paper social security benefits , health care , tax and court treatment , etc gays are taxed equally but receive less in government benefits than heterosexuals",-1,+1,0

gayRights,"no statement contained within any of my arguments asserts that homosexuals are biologically incapable of sexual reproduction the terms of my arguments were carefully chosen so as to not exclude the ability of homosexuals to sexually reproduce yet , in order for them to sexually reproduce and propagate their genetics through a progeny they must act contrary to their nature and have unprotected sex with the opposite gender , and probably more than once now , since they actually are biologically capable of becoming progenitors we must therefore conclude they are not willing to do what is necessary to become parents they choose to do that which will never produce offspring and are suffering the consequences of their choices moreover , if they dont like the consequences of their choices they ought to change their minds conclusion individuals of the homosexual orientation can become progenitors yet , they choose to not do what must be done in order to become progenitors and finally , no man or woman has the right to become a parent parenthood is not a right parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction and no man or woman can justly claim authority over the progeny of another progenitor without the progenitors conference of authority over its progeny","well spoken , yet i cannot agree with you in your conclusion you state that there is an aspect of choice there are a few ways i can interpret your second sentence \( in the conclusion \) here is mine , individuals of homosexual orientation can become progenitors by choice , but must do this by an act that goes against their sexual orientation thus , their sexual orientation is against that of a progenitor and since progenitors are what create life and that very creation of life is a consequence of sexual reproduction , parenthood is formed now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what i called maintenance is what i'm directly interested in yes , parenthood is , in part , the result of progenitors , but it is also very much so the raising and the nurturing aspect as well when adoption is going to take place the progenitor parent s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child in that aspect , they give up their rights to parenthood you state that parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction , which i do not disagree , but another aspect of parenthood is the raising and nurturing having the ability to raise or nurture or both does not have reference to sexual orientation since this is the most important aspect to parenthood then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent perhaps they are n't the progenitors , but are fully capable of parenting thus , any human can posses the abilities to parent because of this a homosexual couple can posses the abilities to parent and thus have a right to be offered the option of adoption",-1,+1,0

gayRights,"yes , you have rightly understood the conclusion of my recent argument with which you do not agree next , you stated in the second paragraph , now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what i called maintenance is what i'm directly interested in my response the premise posits that the term parenthood has , many definitions it also , propositionally , establishes that the argument is based upon multiple definitions of the same term \( this is a non discreet way of using the fallacy of ambiguity to argue through to an ambiguous conclusion \) the introduction of ambiguity into a debate is nothing more than an attempt to redefine the key term s of the debate to prove a predetermined a conclusion and moreover , the explicit claim that more than one definition will be used for the same term invalidates the entirety of the argument however , disregarding what your intent may or may not be , i will continue with my rebuttal of the remainder of your argument wherein we disagree you stated when adoption is going to take place the progenitor parent s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child in that aspect , they give up their rights to parenthood my response if what you claim is true then lets test the principle of that proposition by application of the principle the principle when a man or woman no longer wants to be responsible for that which is theirs , they no longer have rights to that which is theirs \( lucidly stated for the debate \) a a husband and wife decide they want to get rid of their house they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the house b a husband and wife decide to offer up their car for free they no longer have a right to choose whom takes the car c a husband and wife decide to give up their animal pets they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the pets all three examples contradict the reality of the transfer of ownership albeit , a thief is more likely to agree with the examples than the common person for the thief presumes it is now his her property for the taking all parents have the natural law of authority of ownership and must first transfer that authority unto another party before another party can rightfully claim the same authority over the respective property whether it is of children , vehicles , houses , or pets lets move on to the next statement you claimed since this , \( to raise or nurture \) , is the most important aspect to parenthood then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent my response children of the age 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , demonstrate that it is possible for them to possess a nurturing or raising nature therefore they are possible targets to be parents individuals who suffer from diseases of the mind also meet the same criteria should they too be allowed to adopt \? pedophiles exactly meet the criteria should they be allowed to adopt \? the most hardened criminals meet the criteria should they be allowed to adopt \? the ultimate conclusion , logically deduced from my arguments , is that no man , woman , or institution has authority to determine the recipient of the transfer of authority of that which is not theirs to begin with , including myself no one in the world has a right to adopt no institution in the world has a right to adopt for if we argue that some have a right to adopt then we must reason that they have authority to steal that which belongs to another person a homosexual has no right to adopt however , the sister of a homosexual has the authority to transfer authority of her child to her homosexual sibling no right is necessary and the friend of the sister has no right to determine the recipient of the authority therefore , no gay has a right to adopt which is the actual question of the debate","from my understanding , the topic is gay adoption and should the opportunity of adoption be extended to those in a homosexual relationship whether if be a man and a man or a women and a women as a couple having the opportunity to raise a child also , the topic makes mention of human interaction with the child , during the raising and nurturing , from a male and a female can the same be done with two of the same sex \? i would argue that you cannot compare apples to oranges that is why i was interested in the specific points of nurture and the ability to raise which you so eloquently wrote out and felt the need to go into an extreme situation while i do understand what you are stating , that is why we have a legal system in place this is to prevent what us society would not consider a suitable parent what you fail to address is how a gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit please refer to the 1st page of this book source http books google com books \? hl en lr id ncmxvbx agc oi fnd pg pr3 dq adoption law ot s bmkbelptsd sig egnn46precgkj75qw1ul ux0gcnm ppa1 , m1 you will find that adoption is considered the creation of a parent child relationship by judicial order between two parties who usually are unrelated",-1,+1,0

gayRights,"yes , you have rightly understood the conclusion of my recent argument with which you do not agree next , you stated in the second paragraph , now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what i called maintenance is what i'm directly interested in my response the premise posits that the term parenthood has , many definitions it also , propositionally , establishes that the argument is based upon multiple definitions of the same term \( this is a non discreet way of using the fallacy of ambiguity to argue through to an ambiguous conclusion \) the introduction of ambiguity into a debate is nothing more than an attempt to redefine the key term s of the debate to prove a predetermined a conclusion and moreover , the explicit claim that more than one definition will be used for the same term invalidates the entirety of the argument however , disregarding what your intent may or may not be , i will continue with my rebuttal of the remainder of your argument wherein we disagree you stated when adoption is going to take place the progenitor parent s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child in that aspect , they give up their rights to parenthood my response if what you claim is true then lets test the principle of that proposition by application of the principle the principle when a man or woman no longer wants to be responsible for that which is theirs , they no longer have rights to that which is theirs \( lucidly stated for the debate \) a a husband and wife decide they want to get rid of their house they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the house b a husband and wife decide to offer up their car for free they no longer have a right to choose whom takes the car c a husband and wife decide to give up their animal pets they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the pets all three examples contradict the reality of the transfer of ownership albeit , a thief is more likely to agree with the examples than the common person for the thief presumes it is now his her property for the taking all parents have the natural law of authority of ownership and must first transfer that authority unto another party before another party can rightfully claim the same authority over the respective property whether it is of children , vehicles , houses , or pets lets move on to the next statement you claimed since this , \( to raise or nurture \) , is the most important aspect to parenthood then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent my response children of the age 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , demonstrate that it is possible for them to possess a nurturing or raising nature therefore they are possible targets to be parents individuals who suffer from diseases of the mind also meet the same criteria should they too be allowed to adopt \? pedophiles exactly meet the criteria should they be allowed to adopt \? the most hardened criminals meet the criteria should they be allowed to adopt \? the ultimate conclusion , logically deduced from my arguments , is that no man , woman , or institution has authority to determine the recipient of the transfer of authority of that which is not theirs to begin with , including myself no one in the world has a right to adopt no institution in the world has a right to adopt for if we argue that some have a right to adopt then we must reason that they have authority to steal that which belongs to another person a homosexual has no right to adopt however , the sister of a homosexual has the authority to transfer authority of her child to her homosexual sibling no right is necessary and the friend of the sister has no right to determine the recipient of the authority therefore , no gay has a right to adopt which is the actual question of the debate","no offense taken , i rather enjoy a good debate i see where i 've been butting my head the whole time i 've been trying to comprehend grasp the concept , logically , of the homosexual being inescapably self centered please explain i understand the logic of your explanation on the topic of the negative conclusion burden of proof i must understand your logic prior to being able to bring up this in a logical manner please forgive me for having you reiterate your main point but i must understand it",-1,+1,0

marijuana,"i will argue first from a practical position , then philosophical , then historical marijuana is not dangerous there has been a death recorded due to marijuana the ld50 or amount that it would take to kill half the population is incredibly high far higher you can reasonably say it is so high , it is impossible to die from overdosing on marijuana also marijuana does not make you stupid the reason people think this , is that there was a study done on monkey where they let them breathe only marijuana smoke and they died from hypoxia or lack of oxygen when you die from a lack of oxygen , your brain cells die the severe errors in the study , however , were released much later than the results so there is now a stigma that marijuana use makes you stupid they have found that smoking marijuana does not cause cancer like cigarette smoke a ucla study found no link the gateway drug theory is actually perpetuated by the prohibition of marijuana because marijuana users must get pot from drug dealers , they are exposed to harder , dangerous drugs if marijuana was able to be sold in stores , this would not happen legalizing marijuana would not lead to an increase in use by children according to many studies , it is vastly easier for teenagers to get marijuana than it is for them them to get alcohol this is because alcohol must be purchased through legal channels where vendors check for ids however , because of the black market for marijuana drug dealers do not care how old someone is when they sell them pot the legalization of marijuana will be very good for the economy we spend billions of dollars each year to keep people in prison because they like to get high and relax additionally marijuana is a huge cash crop the government could make a lot of money off from taxation it is the number one cash crop in california for example 60 of the money of mexican drug cartels is earned by selling marijuana in the us severely compromising their funding would reduce crime in the united states as well as mexico , which would help improve mexico 's living conditions and curb illegal immigration into the united states the government should not have a right to prohibit you from doing something to yourself that does not harm anyone else it is not illegal to go home and drink a gallon of paint thinner , but i guarantee that it 's much better for both you and society that you smoke marijuana instead of drinking paint thinner here 's a more reasonable example should the government make it illegal to consume significantly more calories than you expend \? this is much more harmful than marijuana , and obesity related illnesses are one of the leading causes of death the bottom line is that this type of reasoning that the government needs to be able to protect you from yourself is dangerously close to fascism where do you draw the line \? do we monitor people 's jobs and make it illegal to not work hard to make sure people are productive and that they get promoted \? do we make it illegal to be late for job interviews because that is bad for you \? do we make it illegal to sleep in beds instead of on the floor because people have died this way and no one has ever died from marijuana \? the answer is no adults are free to make their own decisions that only affect themselves we do not live in a nanny state as ron paul puts it many people assume that because marijuana is illegal serious research and thinking went into the decision to ban it this simply is n't true the first marijuana laws in the united states forced people to grow marijuana during colonial times marijuana became illegal for a few reasons one was due to extreme anti latino and anti black sentiment people were fear mongered into believing that minorities were a danger to white society especially due to marijuana the reefer madness campaign created undue hysteria yellow journalism and personal career advancement also played a role in fact president nixon commissioned a report on marijuana which concluded that marijuana should not be illegal http www druglibrary org schaffer library studies nc ncmenu htm the next logical question is why is marijuana still illegal again there are a few reasons what kept it illegal during the middle and late 1900s was again a fear mongering campaign linking marijuana use and communism by this point in history there is so much social stigma against marijuana , that if you ask someone against legalization why it should be illegal , they will most likely cite things that simply are n't true additionally the alcohol and tobacco industries are absolutely huge companies in those industries make a so much money that they can spend vast amounts lobbying congress to keep marijuana illegal they do n't want competition why would you drink or smoke tobacco when they are incredibly dangerous and addictive when you can smoke marijuana which is harmless and not addictive \? many people underestimate the effect that a large lobby can have on national and state policy the alcohol and tobacco companies also perpetuate the social stigma against marijuana by funding anti drug and anti marijuana advertisements and programs the goal of these programs is not to make you not do drugs , its to stop you from doing drugs that they do n't sell you also marijuana for medicinal purposes is a huge threat to the pharmaceutical industry the pharmaceutical industry is the biggest industry in the united states just like the tobacco and alcohol companies , pharmaceutical companies spend millions of dollars lobbying congress marijuana has been some doctors as the single best drug for maintaining health it combats an astonishing number of diseases and conditions , and has no side effects compare that to the multitude of side effects from prescription drugs it has become a cliche how at the end of television commercials for prescription drugs they rattle off a long list of some pretty serious side effects thousands of people die from adverse reactions to prescription drugs as i hope you can see , the prohibition of marijuana is completely wrong on many levels making marijuana legal will keep it away from kids , keep people away from dangerous hard drugs , and allow adults to make their own choices when it comes to their own lives","you are a fuckin genious , you should get a nobile prize for writing this , man oh man especially i liked the part where you say marijuana is not dangerous , its like saying driving a tank in the middle of the street while you are drunk and there are little kinds around you , is not dangerous man , you are a fuckin genius not dangerous , rlmao , my ass is not dangerous , marijuana is it is weapon , a drug , it is like a bullet , uncontrolable",+1,-1,0

marijuana,"the reasons for why pot should be legalized are all legitamite but people are only looking at the big picture sure it can benifet society in many ways but their are so many down sides to legalizing pot if everyone were to become pot attics they would become more and more addicting up to the point that all they want to do is smoke pot allot of people are probably reading this and thinking that i am completly wrong , but the fact of the matter is that if you smoke pot long enough your mind will strictly be wrapped around trying to get high with that said , how will our society progress if every has their minds on obtaining pot our world will not become more advanced because everyone who was one smart is now a pot head ! who will be the guy to cure cancer if everyone is on pot \? \?","actually , i 've smoked marijuana before and i never wanted to do it again sure , that 's just me but come on are you really telling me that people who do n't do it now are going to do it if it 's legalized \? if someone wants to do it , they 're going to do it whether or not it 's legal \( proof is everyone smoking pot today \) anyways , how many people do you know to smoke pot \? from the sound of it , everyone must , because you 're saying that everyone will be hooked on the stuff if it becomes legalized i do n't think that many people \( including the person or people that will , 'cure cancer' \) want to waste their time smoking it this is strictly from my point of view , and i'm only pointing out that there is a vast majority of people who do not smoke now what does that mean \? there will be \( hopefully ! \) a vast majority of people who do n't smoke , if and when marijuana becomes legalized just because a lot of people drink does n't mean everyone does just because a lot of people smoke cigarettes does n't mean every person does and just because a lot of people overeat certainly does not mean that everyone does consider athletes , for example i'm not so sure that if it actually is legalized everything will be perfect , but then again nothing is , really if one looks at alcohol there is still a giant reoccuring problem with drinking and driving despite educational tools used in schools , teens still do it even adults do there will always be people who think they are capable of doing something they are clearly not",-1,+1,0

marijuana,"although i consider myself liberal , this is one issue that i strongly oppose ! marijuana , like tobacco , causes cancer as it contains carcinogens marijuana is also highly addictive the tetrahydrocannabinol in it is what causes the addiction which make people crave it studies have also shown that uses of marijuana usually lead to more dangerous drugs such as meth and cocaine if you believe that marijuana does not kill people , try telling that to the relatives of the 30 , 000 people in mexico that died due to drug violence yes , marijuana is not the only drug that cartels produce and sell , but it is one of them the only form it should be legal in is a medical form but should be used with intense care","marijuana , like tobacco , causes cancer as it contains carcinogens in the quest to investigate the link between cancer and marijuana , research can be roughly divided into two categories lab research and investigation of long term users outside of the lab yes , as an unfortunate amount of lab animal deaths can attest , cannabis does contain carcinogenic molecules however , research involving actual users paints a rather different picture http scienceblog com 10660 study finds no link between marijuana use and lung cancer http yourlife usatoday com health story 2012 01 10 marijuana doesnt harm lung function study says 52483604 1 there is some controversy regarding the efficacy of these findings because marijuana is illegal , it is difficult to find users to participate in these studies , particularly finding heavy long term users it has been argued that if it were legalized , it would be much easier to find participants from a wider range of the population , and the information gathered could prove to be more accurate still , working with what we 've got , it appears that marijuana use not only does not have anywhere near the effect that cigarette smoking does in terms of carcinogenic properties , it even seems to lower rates of certain types of cancer marijuana is also highly addictive not highly it is significantly less addicting than tobacco or alcohol , about on the same level as caffeine , but usually with less severe withdrawal symptoms pretty much anything that stimulates the reward centers of the brain will have some addictive qualities among a large enough sampling of users but marijuana is very low on the totem pole compared to many legal and even non regulated substances http www psychologytoday com blog the teenage mind 201012 is marijuana addictive http health ezinemark com the addictiveness of marijuana or cannabis 31e84cc7129 html studies have also shown that uses of marijuana usually lead to more dangerous drugs such as meth and cocaine studies have also shown that most marijuana users drank alcohol before smoking pot but alcohol is not considered a gateway drug why \? lower incidence of illegal drug use but lets think about this for a second as long as marijuana is illegal the people who use it can be classified as people who are willing to break at least one law among adults , alcohol drinkers are n't classified that way some might be willing to , and those who are may end up using illegal drugs others will be totally law abiding , and since that is the majority of them , alcohol does not get considered a gateway drug the only way to fairly compare the two would be to put them on the same legal standing and do studies at that point further , people who buy marijuana illegally have a greater exposure to other illegal drugs than those who do n't since many dealers deal in multiple drugs i suspect that the legal status of marijuana plays more of a role in its status as a gateway drug than any actual medical reason if you believe that marijuana does not kill people , try telling that to the relatives of the 30 , 000 people in mexico that died due to drug violence the war on drugs is at least partially to blame here first , the strategy behind the wod is to increase the cost but since most drugs , marijuana included , are highly elastic commodities , this does n't much reduce the demand instead it makes for wealthier drug lords , and competition between them leads to violence the harder we crack down , the worse the situation gets also , we would make it less profitable for the drug lords by opening a legal channel of distribution and cultivation having marijuana as a legitimate source of retail would seriously reduce the number of people obtaining it illegally it could also be regulated for quality and purity this way , which is currently not possible",-1,+1,0

marijuana,"when it comes to my point of view on the legalization of marijuana i believe that there is no reason what so ever for it to remain illegal i'm not going to go into detail explaining what many have already said , about the medical uses , stress relief , etc , but when it comes to the profit that could be made this way , an enormous amount of opportunities open up first thing that comes to mind with the legal sale of marijuana is tax why have a tax other then sales tax \? hell , why not \? are you not willing to pay that extra amount to be able to legally smoke \? is that extra tax not worth being able to sit in clear view and toke it up without worrying about going to jail if you 're caught \? of course it is ! realistically , we could add the cigarette tax from each state onto a package of joints 4 average rolled joints at 10 tax sure , you 're getting slightly less than a dime 's worth , but again , that extra amount is more than worth it if marijuana was to be considered for legalization , and lets say they were to use texas as the beta state , a package of 4 joints would cost 11 41 after tax lets say joe goes through the average dime in about 2 days that 's 178 dime bags in a year as of now that would cost him 1780 , and it would cost 2030 98 if it was legalized and taxed that is 250 98 more than he would normally pay for a slightly less amount of weed about 1 gram per package to be exact , on average that is 250 98 in profit to the government , in 1 year , from 1 man that means slightly under 4000 people \( 3985 \) would allow the government to make a profit of one million dollars did i mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs \? imagine this 6458 \( adjusted for the california cigarette tax \) people in california smoke marijuana once it has become legalized that 's 1 million in profit , in addition to saving the 100 million that it is estimated to spend yearly on arrest and court costs i'm failing to see the problem with this idea on a large scale , i think i read somewhere about 10 of the american population admitted to smoking marijuana the last estimated count was about 303 8 million people in the us , so 30 38 million have admitted to regular use the average tax on cigarettes around the us is about 53 per pack , at even just 1 dime per week , equals to an average profit of 837 27 million dollars annually this estimate does not include the millions of americans who did not admit to their regular use , nor to the hundreds of millions that would be saved on arrest and court costs in addition , think of all the new job openings of adding several large scale marijuana plantations hundreds of job possibilities open up , allowing the percentage of jobless adults to decrease hell , make a few new college courses about marijuana history , growing marijuana , the cultivation of marijuana easily opening up new job opportunities for people to strive for sure , it 's not the perfect job , but if you can convince people to go to school for it , and make a college degree required to work on the plantation , i bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind all of these are just estimates and i have no way of knowing any exacts but as my estimates are reasonable , and pretty close to being exact with the information i 've researched , even if it did n't provide an adequate source to replace paper products , or medical uses , or any of the other dozen things that marijuana is useful for , the profit in taxes and the annual savings in court costs and the job opportunities more than justify the legalization of marijuana",not only would we make all that money in tax revenue but people would be so high that they would n't care about the economy anymore \),+1,+1,1

marijuana,"i will argue first from a practical position , then philosophical , then historical marijuana is not dangerous there has been a death recorded due to marijuana the ld50 or amount that it would take to kill half the population is incredibly high far higher you can reasonably say it is so high , it is impossible to die from overdosing on marijuana also marijuana does not make you stupid the reason people think this , is that there was a study done on monkey where they let them breathe only marijuana smoke and they died from hypoxia or lack of oxygen when you die from a lack of oxygen , your brain cells die the severe errors in the study , however , were released much later than the results so there is now a stigma that marijuana use makes you stupid they have found that smoking marijuana does not cause cancer like cigarette smoke a ucla study found no link the gateway drug theory is actually perpetuated by the prohibition of marijuana because marijuana users must get pot from drug dealers , they are exposed to harder , dangerous drugs if marijuana was able to be sold in stores , this would not happen legalizing marijuana would not lead to an increase in use by children according to many studies , it is vastly easier for teenagers to get marijuana than it is for them them to get alcohol this is because alcohol must be purchased through legal channels where vendors check for ids however , because of the black market for marijuana drug dealers do not care how old someone is when they sell them pot the legalization of marijuana will be very good for the economy we spend billions of dollars each year to keep people in prison because they like to get high and relax additionally marijuana is a huge cash crop the government could make a lot of money off from taxation it is the number one cash crop in california for example 60 of the money of mexican drug cartels is earned by selling marijuana in the us severely compromising their funding would reduce crime in the united states as well as mexico , which would help improve mexico 's living conditions and curb illegal immigration into the united states the government should not have a right to prohibit you from doing something to yourself that does not harm anyone else it is not illegal to go home and drink a gallon of paint thinner , but i guarantee that it 's much better for both you and society that you smoke marijuana instead of drinking paint thinner here 's a more reasonable example should the government make it illegal to consume significantly more calories than you expend \? this is much more harmful than marijuana , and obesity related illnesses are one of the leading causes of death the bottom line is that this type of reasoning that the government needs to be able to protect you from yourself is dangerously close to fascism where do you draw the line \? do we monitor people 's jobs and make it illegal to not work hard to make sure people are productive and that they get promoted \? do we make it illegal to be late for job interviews because that is bad for you \? do we make it illegal to sleep in beds instead of on the floor because people have died this way and no one has ever died from marijuana \? the answer is no adults are free to make their own decisions that only affect themselves we do not live in a nanny state as ron paul puts it many people assume that because marijuana is illegal serious research and thinking went into the decision to ban it this simply is n't true the first marijuana laws in the united states forced people to grow marijuana during colonial times marijuana became illegal for a few reasons one was due to extreme anti latino and anti black sentiment people were fear mongered into believing that minorities were a danger to white society especially due to marijuana the reefer madness campaign created undue hysteria yellow journalism and personal career advancement also played a role in fact president nixon commissioned a report on marijuana which concluded that marijuana should not be illegal http www druglibrary org schaffer library studies nc ncmenu htm the next logical question is why is marijuana still illegal again there are a few reasons what kept it illegal during the middle and late 1900s was again a fear mongering campaign linking marijuana use and communism by this point in history there is so much social stigma against marijuana , that if you ask someone against legalization why it should be illegal , they will most likely cite things that simply are n't true additionally the alcohol and tobacco industries are absolutely huge companies in those industries make a so much money that they can spend vast amounts lobbying congress to keep marijuana illegal they do n't want competition why would you drink or smoke tobacco when they are incredibly dangerous and addictive when you can smoke marijuana which is harmless and not addictive \? many people underestimate the effect that a large lobby can have on national and state policy the alcohol and tobacco companies also perpetuate the social stigma against marijuana by funding anti drug and anti marijuana advertisements and programs the goal of these programs is not to make you not do drugs , its to stop you from doing drugs that they do n't sell you also marijuana for medicinal purposes is a huge threat to the pharmaceutical industry the pharmaceutical industry is the biggest industry in the united states just like the tobacco and alcohol companies , pharmaceutical companies spend millions of dollars lobbying congress marijuana has been some doctors as the single best drug for maintaining health it combats an astonishing number of diseases and conditions , and has no side effects compare that to the multitude of side effects from prescription drugs it has become a cliche how at the end of television commercials for prescription drugs they rattle off a long list of some pretty serious side effects thousands of people die from adverse reactions to prescription drugs as i hope you can see , the prohibition of marijuana is completely wrong on many levels making marijuana legal will keep it away from kids , keep people away from dangerous hard drugs , and allow adults to make their own choices when it comes to their own lives",very well put excellent work you have tackled the debate from many different angles and have covered a lot of ground from many different perspectives hopefully this educates a large number of individuals,+1,+1,1

marijuana,"in reality or whatever passes for reality in your mind marijuana is just as bad as tobacco and alcohol can you provide any evidence \? you see , i can provide a lot to indicate otherwise alcohol kills , according to norml , around 85 , 000 people a year ! tobacco kills 435 , 000 people each year ! then we come down to good ol' mary jane , and she is n't responsible for a single death marijuana is proven to be a gateway drug marijuana has been proven to not be a gateway drug into crack cocaine , heroin nope opium who the hell does opium any more \? ! \? it is also proven that the typical marijuana user smokes until high , not until relaxed depends on the user i 've known people who smoked until they greened out , but others only take a toke or two to relax when a person is high , he or she is not fully functional this is based purely on personal observation , but i 'd say that one is more functional when high , but functional in a different manner most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk , they drink until they 're relaxed yet it still is more damaging to the body than weed ! marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco depends on how much you smoke all day every day , probably but most people are n't like that however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does you hear about drunk driving all the time , but i 've never heard of a case where the only intoxicant involved was ganja marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain willing to provide evidence for this \? even with 3 weeks of abstinence of marijuana , attention span is permanently affected but motor skills , planning ability , and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected as somebody who actually smokes pot occasionally , i disagree with this with marijuana use , the brain is working harder than it should causing stress , shorter life span , and a weaker body in the long run that just sounds plain ridiculous ! though marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues slow down \? ! cheeba saves lives ! it still only slows down , does not cure the medical issue depends on the issue , i should imagine it helps people going through chemo to eat , which is pretty damn useful if you want to , you know , live same goes with prescription medicine compare the negative side effects of , say , just about any prescription medicine with the negative side effects of sensimilla i dare you the reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it the reason prescription medicines are legal is because politicians , doctors , and those involved with big pharma make shitloads of money from their legality i'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you , however most of the time , that is not the case fortunately herb should be used because of its benefits to all , not just the sick marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults as well as many adults most people , once again in my experience , do not abuse it most people use it recreationally , and it does less harm than good there is a reason the future of america \( and the world \) is going downhill too many trillions wasted on finding and incarcerating those non violent users of drugs \? the increased marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons mull use is goin' down !","yes , i find it interesting that everything you 've said are things that i agree with , and i find it interesting that i 've done a lot of research on it , yet before i did the research , my opinion was the same as the guy you 're disputing it is interesting how a lack of knowledge about a topic requiring knowledge , rather than keeping people away , actually draws people in if you are not interested in smoking the reefer , then do n't smoke it if you do not enjoy greek plays , then do not learn greek and do not go to greek plays with your uninformed and antagonistic opinion i , however love greek plays and even though greek plays do upset some people , there are much worse problems in the world for one , why does the government outlaw a plant , but it does n't outlaw war \? in fact , why does the government support war \? what is war \? killing perhaps one should questions your government 's motives before blindly obeying",+1,+1,1

marijuana,"ok that is fine , good explanations but if they legalize weed and see how much of a problem it becomes then make it illegal again , it will only make things worse remember prohibition \? i 've never done any drugs myself , sure i 've drank my share of alcohol and i'm not even of age to do so , but i'm not a drunk and i was n't calling you a pothead , i was saying it in general i just feel it 'll cause more problems in the long run with people becoming addicted to it and needing help to get off of it and as far as it goes for medicinal purposes , marijuana does not cure anything in which many people try and use that excuse because they think it does it is for the sole purpose of numbing the pain in cancer patients in which they can switch to other alternatives and also making patients hungry so they eat more and gain weight on their sick bodies","first , you have done drugs yourself , because alcohol is a drug it 's simply a legal one like tobacco and as someone who has been around both and tried both and tried both in excess , it 's my opinion that alcohol is a far more dangerous drug than marijuana marijuana does inflict harm to the self , but that 's where it ends people do n't get high and then get belligerent , angry , and violent they do n't get high and drive overconfidently at 90 mph i'm not saying driving under the influence of marijuana is by any means safe , but in comparison to alcohol , it is a lot safer when you 're under the influence of alcohol , you become overconfident in your abilities and drive without the normal care and caution you would have your vision is also blurred and reaction times slowed under marijuana , again your reaction times are slowed , but unlike using alcohol , when you drive under the influence of marijuana you drive with more care and caution than normal it 's the positive effect of paranoia furthermore , you can overdose on alcohol and die from it , which is an impossibility with marijuana it 's interesting that you bring up prohibition and then state that you 're afraid it will cause problems because people will become addicted to it prohibition is an excellent example to bring up what did history teach us about prohibition \? that it does n't work people will always self medicate , and so long as the substances they are using are absent of any serious effects , they will continue using those substances in fact , legalization of marijuana may cut down on the gateway effect of the drug \( though i do n't buy the gateway argument in and of itself , but more on that later \) many people try marijuana after being taught by the government 's propaganda what a terrible awful drug it is once they try it and learn the truth , that it 's very similar to alcohol , with a few key differences , they begin to question the government 's authority on other drugs as well if they lied to me about marijuana , maybe cocaine 's not all that bad either on the other hand , let me say this to the gateway argument tobacco and alcohol are the number one and number two gateway drugs so if we call marijuana a gateway , let us only do so after calling out the top two as far as medicinal marijuana goes , you 've obviously either done little to no research on the topic or you lack compassion you state that cancer patients use it to numb the pain of treatment and to make them hungry in order to counteract the effects of nausea from treatment i ask , what is wrong with that \? it seems that if people are going through a very painful and difficult treatment \( that may not even succeed \) they might be entitled to pain relief and some semblance of a normal life \( i e being able to eat normally \) nobody claims that marijuana cures anything , it 's pain medication , much like morphine , demerol , vicodin , etc and it 's natural no pharmaceutical company has mixed in chemical compounds to create it i get terrible menstrual cycles , they 've always been awful and have gotten worse as i 've gotten a bit older the only thing that successfully treats the pain and discomfort i feel during those first two days is , you guessed it , marijuana prohibition has been tried for seventy years and rather than reduce marijuana use , now nearly half of the country admits to having tried the substance we waste money on criminalization of marijuana and we create crime if marijuana were available legally , drug dealers would be out of business , and users would no longer have to be jailed at your expense the government would be able to tax the substance and make a pretty penny off of people 's use of it as well there 's no proof that use of marijuana would increase if prohibition ended it would make us all safer and save us a ton of money i'm sick of the hypocrisy of alcohol users in regards to marijuana if you want to oppose it , fine , but you sure as hell better oppose it 's uglier , scarier brother , alcohol , first",-1,+1,0

marijuana , including water filtering which removes a significant amount of tar and dangerous chemicals , vaporizing which releases only the thc and no harmful chemicals , and eating which also releases no tar or dangerous chemicals second evidence evidence shows that tar from cannabis cigarettes contains 50 more cancer causing carcinogens than tobacco as i said earlier this is a really dishonest thing to say while it may contain more carcinogens , it does n't cause cancer numerous studies have failed to find any link yet there are an immeasurable number of studies that show the direct link between tobacco smoke and cancer think about it , if marijuana smoke was so much worse than tobacco smoke , or even bad all , why are there no studies showing it actually causes cancer , but so many showing tobacco causes cancer there is even research marijuana may kill cancerous cells and leave healthy cells alone http www salem news com articles january112008 cancer treatment 11008

marijuana,"laws are n't really doing anything to stop cannabis consumption , anyway if you legalized , you could tax it too sure , legalize marijuana but that 's not the problem , is it \? but i am personally against recreational drug use why is life so boring that one requires external stimulants \? unless restricted live in a cell forever and the like , it 's always possible go something with your life society did n't spend all those years on people , raising them , feeding them , just to waste resources","yeah , but what about alcohol and tobacco \? it 's ok for those substances to be legal \? some people like to use recreational drugs because it gives them a different perspective of things sure , it 's harmful for their bodies but who are we to say what they can and cannot do to themselves \? personally i 'd prefer more stoners around than all the murders that occur because of the illegal trafficking",-1,+1,0
marijuana,that seems illogical we should n't keep laws just because of the negative side affects the law has had does will have on society why would the government want society to have any negative aspects \? is n't it the government 's job to create laws to keep society a positive aspect rather than an anarchy \?,"i 'll clear it up a bit first of all , an increase in cannabis users is n't a bad thing , but thats a different argument if it were bad , though , it 's only happening as a side affect of laws to begin with also , just because something is bad in the short term , does n't mean it ca n't have long term beneficial side affects also , the government does n't want that but it still happens interracial marriage was illegal african american voting was once illegal , but now we have an african american president",-1,+1,0
obama,"now with osama dead , all the more reason to vote him for another term , or three ! ! \)","i agree osama 's death is some proof that obama is a good leader he did not reveal he knew where osama was in his campaign , which would have guaranteed his victory this makes him an ideal president",+1,+1,1
obama,you really should at least give credit to those that you copy and pasted that from as for those accomplishments you do realize that not everyone considers them all to be as such \? right \?,you really should at least give credit to those that you copy and pasted that from facts do n't require credit he either did those things or he did not as for those accomplishments you do realize that not everyone considers them all to be as such \? right \? an unnecessary equivocation,-1,+1,0
obama,"i happen to think he 's doing awsome , even if one disagrees , this hatred cannot possibly be based in reality because everyone who disagrees with you must not be involved in reality as for your list of accomplishments it was rather clever of you to use a link to another forums and by doing so hiding the fact that the list is from dailykos i wish i could color code stuff , but bold will represent things that are nothing special or would have most likely been done by mccain and italics will represent something that should not be the government 's job or something that is not even an accomplishment 1 taxes are the main gripe of all those fat pasty tea party weirdos yet this very year is the least taxes americans have paid then at any time during the bush administration where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office \? cutting taxes is something that just about any leader would do in a recession , its the future tax hikes to cancel out the huge deficits that people are pissed about 2 spending has actually been cut , and everyone conveniently ignored that obama finally ended the f 22 program which presidents have been trying to elimante but could n't because they were not cool enough since bush sr in fact obama has passed 60 of cuts , much more than bush jr hence actually shrinking the size of government 82 69 billion dollar deficits this april , though it is nice to see the military industrial complex get a kick in the balls 3 every nation that has ever passed a healthcare plan similar to the one obama passed was happy for it and held that residing government in great esteem in subsequent generations this will be no different if nothing else he has already assured his spot in world history as a great american president for this alone despite knee jerk there 's a monster in your closet reaction from the perpetually scared right i'm sure the free riders in this country will love it and those who realize that we have no way to pay for it will hate 4 due to the stimulus package , the economy is improving here is a jobs chart link and that is actually off , we actually gained 200 , 000 jobs in january the most recent numbers indicate keynesian economics fix something in the short run only to see it fail even more in the long run 5 we are leaving iraq , and we are doing better in afghanistan since obama took office now that we are actually concentrating on the terrorists responsible for 911 instead of chasing cheyene 's oil interests i oppose the war , but i 'll give him credit for recent success and here 's a list of things obama has done , some may not agree with everything , but at least he is n't at camp david or reading to kindergartners on the tax payer 's dime 1 ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending trying to make agencies more efficient is not a new concept 1 ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices see above 1 instituted enforcement for equal pay for women i 'll give him credit though if women are to except maternity leave then they ought to expect lesser pay 1 beginning the withdrawal of us troops from iraq good 1 families of fallen soldiers have expenses covered to be on hand when the body arrives at dover afb mccain would have likely done something similar 1 ended media blackout on war casualties reporting full information seeing as every tv station not named fox is in the tank for him this is not much of accomplishment 1 ended media blackout on covering the return of fallen soldiers to dover afb the media is now permitted to do so pending adherence to respectful rules and approval of fallen soldier 's family good 1 the white house and federal government are respecting the freedom of information act until what goes on behind closed doors with the federal reserve and obama 's negotiations with unions and democrats this is not much of an accomplishment 1 instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible really \? they are counting this as an accomplishment \? 1 limits on lobbyist 's access to the white house i like this one 1 limits on white house aides working for lobbyists after their tenure in the administration there are still loop holes but if this policy works i 'll give him credit 1 ended the previous stop loss policy that kept soldiers in iraq afghanistan longer than their enlistment date mccain might have done something like this , but i 'll give obama credit 1 phasing out the expensive f 22 war plane and other outdated weapons systems , which were n't even used or needed in iraq afghanistan 1 removed restrictions on embryonic stem cell research 1 federal support for stem cell and new biomedical research i do n't mind stem cell research , but tax payers should not pay for it 1 new federal funding for science and research labs not their job to do so 1 states are permitted to enact federal fuel efficiency standards above federal standards i would respect this if he had a consistent record as to what the states are allowed to 1 increased infrastructure spending \( roads , bridges , power plants \) after years of neglect 1 funds for high speed , broadband internet access to k 12 schools not government 's job 1 new funds for school construction not government 's job , the schools still suck anyways 1 the prison at guantanamo bay is being phased out this one is just fucking retarded and is nothing more then a pr move if he wants to change the prison 's policies then that is one thing , but closing down a prison only to send the prisoners elsewhere is just stupid 1 us auto industry rescue plan propping up failing companies is not an accomplishment 1 housing rescue plan he still needs to fix fannie and freddie 1 789 billion economic stimulus plan the tax cut parts were good , the rest not so much 1 the public can meet with federal housing insurers to refinance \( the new plan can be completed in one day \) a mortgage if they are having trouble paying 1 us financial and banking rescue plan not government 's job 1 the secret detention facilities in eastern europe and elsewhere are being closed good 1 ended the previous policy the us now has a no torture policy and is in compliance with the geneva convention standards good 1 better body armor is now being provided to our troops mccain would have done the same 1 the missile defense program is being cut by 1 4 billion in 2010 good 1 restarted the nuclear nonproliferation talks and building back up the nuclear inspection infrastructure protocols new policy with new president , nothing special 1 reengaged in the treaties agreements to protect the antarctic protect it from what \? 1 reengaged in the agreements talks on global warming and greenhouse gas emissions more bull shit regulations from self righteous environmentalists 1 visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office and now they like us more so what \? 1 successful release of us captain held by somali pirates authorized the seals to do their job do you really think that a republican would have hesitated to have the seals do their job \? 1 us navy increasing patrols off somali coast do you really think that a republican would have hesitated to increased military presence \? 1 attractive tax write offs for those who buy hybrid automobiles preferential treatment to his environmental followers is not an accomplishment 1 cash for clunkers program offers vouchers to trade in fuel inefficient , polluting old cars for new cars stimulated auto sales not the government 's job , no way to pay for the program , japan automakers love us now 1 announced plans to purchase fuel efficient american made fleet for the federal government 1 expanded the schip program to cover health care for 4 million more children not government 's job 1 signed national service legislation expanded national youth service program not government 's job 1 instituted a new policy on cuba , allowing cuban families to return home to visit loved ones he could just lift the ban on cuba altogether seeing as it hurts the cuban people more then it hurts their government 1 ended the previous policy of not regulating and labeling carbon dioxide emissions not government 's job 1 expanding vaccination programs and wasting millions in the process on unused vaccines 1 immediate and efficient response to the floods in north dakota and other natural disasters msnbc was criticizing the government for not doing anything , enforcing something like this after you are chewed out is not an accomplishment 1 closed offshore tax safe havens good 1 negotiated deal with swiss banks to permit us government to gain access to records of tax evaders and criminals good 1 ended the previous policy of offering tax benefits to corporations who outsource american jobs the new policy is to promote in sourcing to bring jobs back good 1 ended the previous practice of protecting credit card companies in place of it are new consumer protections from credit card industry 's predatory practices good 1 energy producing plants must begin preparing to produce 15 of their energy from renewable sources not government 's job 1 lower drug costs for seniors not government 's job 1 ended the previous practice of forbidding medicare from negotiating with drug manufacturers for cheaper drugs the federal government is now realizing hundreds of millions in savings good 1 increasing pay and benefits for military personnel mccain would have done something similar 1 improved housing for military personnel mccain would have done something similar 1 initiating a new policy to promote federal hiring of military spouses mccain would have done something similar 1 improved conditions at walter reed military hospital and other military hospitals mccain would have done something similar 1 increasing student loans not government 's job , not only that but they have failed to address growing tuition costs which negates the benefits of increasing loans 1 increasing opportunities in americorps program ehhh , sure , i like this one 1 sent envoys to middle east and other parts of the world that had been neglected for years reengaging in multilateral and bilateral talks and diplomacy good 1 established a new cyber security office and now he wants the government to be able to take control of the internet in case of emergency 1 beginning the process of reforming and restructuring the military 20 years after the cold war to a more modern fighting force this includes new procurement policies , increasing size of military , new technology and cyber units and operations , etc new president , new policy 1 ended previous policy of awarding no bid defense contracts good 1 ordered a review of hurricane and natural disaster preparedness sounds like something any president would do 1 established a national performance officer charged with saving the federal government money and making federal operations more efficient 1 students struggling to make college loan payments can have their loans refinanced not government 's job , if they really gave a shit then they would have fixed the problem of the rising costs of college , but seeing as the left is in love with academia i doubt that will happen 1 improving benefits for veterans mccain 1 many more press conferences and town halls and much more media access than previous administration narcissism is not an accomplishment 1 instituted a new focus on mortgage fraud good 1 the fda is now regulating tobacco increasing the role of the nanny state is not an accomplishment 1 ended previous policy of cutting the fda and circumventing fda rules increasing the role of the nanny state is not an accomplishment 1 ended previous practice of having white house aides rewrite scientific and environmental rules , regulations , and reports good 1 authorized discussions with north korea and private mission by pres bill clinton to secure the release of two americans held in prisons the reporters were not worth the costs 1 authorized discussions with myanmar and mission by sen jim web to secure the release of an american held captive not worth the costs 1 making more loans available to small businesses 1 established independent commission to make recommendations on slowing the costs of medicare good 1 appointment of first latina to the supreme court i thought race did not matter to the left \? anyways , he appointed some bitch that he knew would agree with him on most issues , that is not an accomplishment that is politicizing the court , though that is nothing new 1 authorized construction opening of additional health centers to care for veterans mccain 1 limited salaries of senior white house aides cut to 100 , 000 they should be making a lot less 1 renewed loan guarantees for israel fuck israel 1 changed the failing status quo military command in afghanistan new president , new policy 1 deployed additional troops to afghanistan mccain 1 new afghan war policy that limits aerial

health insurance and millions more under insured already listed 1 has put the ball in play for comprehensive immigration reform states are passing their own laws because they are tired of inaction at federal level 1 has announced his intention to push for energy reform i was n't aware that simply announcing a plan was an accomplishment and since this is the kos what they mean by reform is cap and

president obama had a unique opportunity in history and he blew it he brought us change indeed he slammed the bush doctrine in all its ugly forms of secrecy and judicial obstruction into executive hyper drive the rhetoric of compassionate conservative now became the drivel of compassionate liberalism if there is one thing americans say about obama it is this he cares he cares for the mechanic in detroit who lost his job he cares for the middle aged couple living in the hooverville tent outside sacramento he cares for the middle class mother and her three kids in toledo spending their nights in a homeless shelter with the addicted and the ignored but does obama really care \? in fact , his compassionate liberalism runs so deep that it pulls a move from the old ronald reagan playbook we knew as trickle down economics these days the compassionate white house grants bail out money to financial monsters like aig and bank of america there could be no better help for the american veteran shivering under a bridge tonight because there just are n't any more jobs \( unless of course , you can beat out the 200 other people applying for that one lonely job opening \) the idea is that bail out money will sooner or later trickle down to the great unwashed masses of americans wondering what in sam hill happened to the real estate market and their retirement accounts it may only be a drop of financial bail out but hey it trickled down next up , bread lines ! the truth is that the white house allowed corporate giant ceos to loot and pilfer the public treasury this administration is following the same tortured logic of the previous one which assured us that falsely accused cab drivers from baghdad were receiving comfortable attention at guantanamo bay the left right political paradigm in this country is a sham \( sorry to disappoint my fellow evangelical christians \) both parties have proven to be big business , big government warmongers for those who actually wished mccain had been elected just think about this the gop would have put up no opposition to the new president 's stimulus package and would have rammed through trillions more in help for america so there you have it president obama is as bad as the worst conservative and as bad as the worst liberal and all with a smile how is the left right scenario a sham \?

for starters , the destruction of individual wealth in this country , save for the high upper class we are on the verge of an economic meltdown that will dwarf the great depression and will take decades to recover there is no need for a conspiracy theory here only the urgency of understanding the mess that we allowed to happen and how we can financially protect ourselves we must not waste time we must move our already compromised and over valued u s dollars into assets of real value this does not include real estate unless you 're buying ten cents or less on the high priced dollar forget your 401 \( k \) , pensions and your annuities unless you can take your money out , they are toast the stock market is one toxic graveyard , particularly finance shares dump them invest in precious metals , food supply , cigarettes , alcohol and medicine for trade and help for your neighbors when the dollar collapses consider buying silver , palladium and gold from reputable sellers like apmex com i personally recommend silverbullion com because i support the goals of the owner jason hommel to bring silver back as the most effective medium of exchange remember , that despite the u s treasury 's naked assertions , the u s constitution expressly reserves the right of individual states to mint legal tender coins so long as they 're gold or silver when the dollar collapses , i do not think that new york city will burn or that the united states will come to an immediate end but if it did , the blame must rest entirely on barack obama and his congressional criminal syndicate some might here criticize me as being unfair after all , george w bush the evangelical nearly bankrupted this country with his illegal wars , his blatant lies to stir americans to bloodshed , his deliberate obstruction to the 9 11 commission , his last minute corporate bailout to the tune of hundreds of billions , his economic tinkering with interest rates , his unconscionable acts of torturing innocent men and children , his doubling of the national debt , et cetera , et cetera but let me be clear about this george w bush is a public menace he and his cadre must be tried and convicted of their crimes but that will never happen under an obama presidency , in spite of the president 's left leaning brand of crony capitalism the truth commission currently at play in the congress is merely a circus show to fool americans into thinking that we actually take seriously the crimes of torture , invasion , occupation , mayhem , pillaging , looting , rape , pollution , perjury , bribery and killing of civilians with illegal weapons of war every moment that the obama administration rolls on without prosecuting the crimes of the former administration , it exists as a de facto confirmation that our new president has sold out to the rich and that he lied to his democratic base and the american voter the white house today has continued in the same deadly bait and switch tactics of the former village idiot in chief additionally , obama has moved to control more media and aggressively solidify relationships with members of the war and bankers party on both sides of the aisle for a president to vociferously take on rush limbaugh the gop 's talk radio attack dog is an alarming signal besides the fact that the democrats want to point out the weakness of the gop 's leadership vacuum , obama is inserting himself into the realm of media and entertainment instead of focusing on how his office can uphold and defend the u s constitution in light of the economic crisis are we really so surprised to see the leftist authoritarian hugo chavez , who is a regular media personality , cheer obama in his nationalization and socialization of the banking and insurance industries \? evangelical christian radio stations are scared stiff about the democratic led congress reviving restrictions on americans to share their religious opinions over the people 's airwaves and they should be concerned \( i particularly enjoy my local station \) after all , the same kind of government that monitors , censors , filters and controls any form of media is the same type of authoritarianism that steals , plunders and coerces its own people one look at china 's control of the internet and google 's sickening overture to that regime is enough to make any civil libertarian 's skin crawl reports that australia is considering chinese style filtering over what their people can access on the internet makes me want to boycott eucalyptus leaves so why is president obama responsible for our economic debacle \?

here is obama 's full memo memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies subject presidential signing statements for nearly two centuries , presidents have issued statements addressing constitutional or other legal questions upon signing bills into law \( signing statements \) particularly since omnibus bills have become prevalent , signing statements have often been used to ensure that concerns about the constitutionality of discrete statutory provisions do not require a veto of the entire bill in recent years , there has been considerable public discussion and criticism of the use of signing statements to raise constitutional objections to statutory provisions there is no doubt that the practice of issuing such statements can be abused constitutional signing statements should not be used to suggest that the president will disregard statutory requirements on the basis of policy disagreements at the same time , such signing statements serve a legitimate function in our system , at least when based on well founded constitutional objections in appropriately limited circumstances , they represent an exercise of the president 's constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and they promote a healthy dialogue between the executive branch and the congress with these considerations in mind and based upon advice of the department of justice , i will issue signing statements to address constitutional concerns only when it is appropriate to do so as a means of discharging my constitutional responsibilities in issuing signing statements , i shall adhere to the following principles 1 the executive branch will take appropriate and timely steps , whenever practicable , to inform the congress of its constitutional concerns about pending legislation such communication should facilitate the efforts of the executive branch and the congress to work together to address these concerns during the legislative process , thus minimizing the number of occasions on which i am presented with an enrolled bill that may require a signing statement 2 because legislation enacted by the congress comes with a presumption of constitutionality , i will strive to avoid the conclusion that any part of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional in exercising my responsibility to determine whether a provision of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional , i will act with caution and restraint , based only on interpretations of the constitution that are well founded 3 to promote transparency and accountability , i will ensure that signing statements identify my constitutional concerns about a statutory provision with sufficient specificity to make clear the nature and basis of the constitutional objection 4 i will announce in signing statements that i will construe a statutory provision in a manner that avoids a constitutional problem only if that construction is a legitimate one to ensure that all signing statements previously issued are followed only when consistent with these principles , executive branch departments and agencies are directed to seek the advice of the attorney general before relying on signing statements issued prior to the date of this memorandum as the basis for disregarding , or otherwise refusing to comply with , any provision of a statute this memorandum is not intended to , and does not , create any right or benefit , substantive or procedural , enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the united states , its departments , agencies , or entities , its officers , employees , or agents , or any other person this memorandum shall be published in the federal register here is a list of obama 's signing statements http www coherentbabble com listbhoall

no does the middle class , yea they contribute small business 's but steve job 's , bill gates , alan mulally , etc , the rich create the majority with jobs and what happens when you tax them to death , well they do n't want to lose all the money of starting new corporations and new enterprises along with the taxes and regulations of the govt and they end up moving their business 's to other countries where they can make a profit did you not read the part where 50 of americans dont pay taxes and the rich make up for the 20 that do \?

obama,"for one he does n't support regressive taxation or flat taxes jobs are not created by the wealthy , but by the entire market","totally , people need to start thinking in terms of maximal aggrigate demand i feel like most right wing economic ideas do not promote maximal aggregate demand and thus i question the right wing economic ideas with respect to their intelligence and justifiability with respect to economic evidence and modern economic theory progressive taxation inspires greater consumption from the group that consumes the greatest the middle class it is the best way to accelerate economic activity as far as i am aware , supply side economics \( i e trickle down economics right wing economics \) is contrary to maximal aggrigate demand because it doesnt promote consumption aggregate demand is the combination of consumptions , investment , govt spending , and net trade activity as far as i know , the wealthy invest and consume at a relatively static level as a group the middle class invest and consume relative to their ability progressive taxation increases this ability for the middle class and thus , in order to maximize aggregate demand we need to policies that promote the middle class \( typically left wing , socialistic policies \) to me it comes down to patriotism , a patriot wants the whole country to do well i question the patriotism of the right wing because their policies tend to undermine total economic wellbeing which is fundamental to maximal economic prosperity",+1,+1,1

i mean i had my suspicions when i saw your name , looks like a gay dating site title , but that aside i did n't really think you were literally retarded until i saw your number 4 point there bush was handed the best economy in the history of the us due to clinton 's policies this massive surplus was literally squandered by that monkey bush in about 3 years due to what you call stimulus which is really just tax cuts for people who do n't need them and wo n't put the money back into the economy and insane deregulation that started with reagan , we went from the greatest us economy in history to the second worst in us history it is truly an accomplishment in itself , how one crappy president with daddy issues can bring an entire economy to it 's knees so quickly now we have an intelligent person in office , and for the first time in about 6 years each month is showing less job losses than the last , and in some instances actual job gains , and still you preach bush era economic strategy it is truly mind boggling how one can be so completely clueless honestly i'm bored of you now i will add though to your bigot comment you do realize that if obama were not black this fake corporate run grass roots tea bagger bs would not happen sure some are just clueless idiots who live in a faux noise media alternate universe and have no idea how backwards their view of what is going on is , but most are pissed because real america as they put it , in there view does not include black people disliking people because of their opinions is far different than comparing a democratically elected president to hitler and insisting he was not born here all because of the color of his skin and i do n't want to hear the old line no that 's not it uh , uh , it 's his policies bullshit where was the tea party in the clinton years \?

of some deep hatred of either liberals or black people or both , or a complete ignorance of the real world","your infatuation with obama is either blinding you completely or you are purposely distorting facts tea party weirdos it is weird to believe in constitutional govt if you think they 're weird , give us reasons , or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot \( someone who makes decisions without facts \) this very year is the least taxes americans have paid then at any time during the bush administration ok , i do n't know if this is a purposeful lie or you just do n't see this tax rates have actually gone up for almost everyone paying taxes , but we are in a massive recession , so tax revenue is down your statement is true but is a huge manipulation of fact ironically , your point only proves why the bush tax cuts should be extended by lowering taxes for certain income brackets , the govt tax revenue actually goes up 2 spending has actually been cut no sure he cut the f 22 program , but the stimulus bill , health care , and a myriad of other programs have skyrocketed federal spending this is just not true sorry 3 every nation that has ever passed a healthcare plan similar to the one obama passed was happy for it so if everyone else is doing it we should too \? most of these countries are having financial meltdowns because of massive deficit spending 4 due to the stimulus package , the economy is improving here is a jobs chart link and that is actually off , we actually gained 200 , 000 jobs in january the most recent numbers indicate again , no first of all , 200 , 000 jobs gained in january are census jobs mostly second , the stimulus package contained almost no stimulus it cannot stimulate the economy because it was almost entirely pork barrel spending and was stimulus in name only that aside , we have clearly lost jobs , as unemployment has gone from 6 to 10 where did that 700 billion dollars go \? and even if we did add jobs , 700 billion for 200k jobs \? it would be cheaper to give 1 million dollars to every american anyway , i'm gonna skim and end , because i think i 've made my point 1 ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending political double speak while he drastically increases spending he attempts to make himself look good by ordering reviews 1 ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices see above 1 instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible while bills like the 1 trillion dollar health care bill are done completely behind closed doors 1 limits on lobbyist 's access to the white house he said but we have seen the heaviest lobbying in white house history under his regime anyway , point being almost everything this man touches turns to dust the budget neutral health care bill has now been revealed by the cbo to be a 1 trillion dollar deficit we are spending 150 of our gdp in deficit spending \( greece is collapsing at only 119 \) he passed student loan reform and no one even knows what it means you say this man will go down

policies as well as obama 's obama 's tried to increase tax on the upper classes , and the corporations , and been blocked by republicans obama supports the bush tax cuts he did not try to end them in any way it 's hardly fair to call him 'the worst president ever' i already pointed out that that title belongs to jimmy carter he is currently the best of a bad lot even romney wishes to use the ryan plan , which would save at least 5 trillion dollars and if romney were to use ryan 's earlier plans , healthcare would be solved and spending would be moderately decreased even more however , the ryan plan is not as good as it should be it is true that ron pauls cut the deficit most quickly , and therefore debt , but it did so at the expense of the economy it 's not just about cutting spending , ron paul wishes to eliminate most federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold federal spending and regulation is what got us here in the first place the war on drugs , the war on terror , the federal reserve , etc obama is just another politician with the same bs that bush brought us the idea that people truly believe him to be a candidate of change is , at times , frustrating the libertarians look to 'save' the economy , but at the expense of the people who it is supposed to help how are they hurting the people it helps federal manipulation of the economy has only led us to here once again , the problem is big government we put so much faith into a group of people who think that manipulation and control of free individuals is the answer it 's a hegemony of slavery","those two links do n't say that he 's lying , they say that he 's misrepresenting information which as my second link shows is the case for both knoller and the people who attack knoller they speak against the validness of the article , and portray good arguments considering there is a lot of problems with the sources of information in regards to this issue , i feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent keynsian economics is not the consensus many believe that increased spending is never a good idea , especially under a recession letting the largest of corporations fail is not only supported by right wing economists but by even some of the left wing revolutionaries \( occupy wall street \) i'm not even talking about how to get out of a recession , i'm talking about the very necessities of his office in a recession , were millions become unemployed , he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of us presidents just in unemployment benefits , keeping the people alive and i have no one argue that government spending should be high in a boom , such as bush did , the second highest debt creator bush had reasons , including the war and humanitarian aid for africa and india \( yeah people forget about that part for some weird reason \) i disagree with bush 's fiscal policies as well as obama 's the war was his choice to enter , and considering the flaky reasons for it , i do not give him any relapse on the trillions it cost considering the us' abysmal foreign aid \( as a percentage of national income \) history , its effects are miniscule on such large amounts of money obama supports the bush tax cuts he did not try to end them in any way he said he would not have signed the bill if it did not include other extensions of relief that were also set to expire among other provisions , he cited the extensions of unemployment benefits and tuition tax credits , as well as new tax incentives for businesses obama acknowledged that there are some elements of this legislation that i do n't like , and some that congressional republicans and democrats do n't like that 's the nature of compromise , yielding on something each of us cares about to move forward on what all of us care about , he said and right now , what all of us care about is growing the american economy and creating jobs for the american people but yes , i 'll concede , i was n't aware of that however , considering the whole buffet tax debate \( estimated to save 47 billion by 2022 \) , i would disagree even romney wishes to use the ryan plan , which would save at least 5 trillion dollars ryan 's plans were the ones that led to this recession \( yes , he designed bush 's budget too \) considering the widespread criticism of his plan , i would hesitate before supporting it , yet alone attaching such massive claims to it it 's not just about cutting spending , ron paul wishes to eliminate most federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold this is what annoys me about ron paul some of his policies are fantastic , ending the war on drugs terror , all that bullshit , but at the same time , he applies his unconventional ideals to everything , and it would just be a bad thing overall but , that 's unrelated how are they hurting the people it helps social support is supposed to help those who need it the most reducing spending on social support , and taxation , increases inequality , and disproportionately affects the poor",-1,+1,0

obama,"please somebody own me on this my answer is going to be lengthy i have a few problems with the question first of all the question is untimely we do n't know who his competitors will be \( even if we think we can guess \) second of all , consequently we have no idea what the competitors ideas or arguments will be the answer is neither yes nor no , it 's i do n't know we have to wait till the evidence is in there is a problem with this as well the problem is that most political reforms do n't have impact till years after they have been approved this makes it hard to evaluate certain decisions while lending reinforcement to the saying hindsight is 20 20 but evolution has blessed us with the gift of playing out scenarios in our heads before they actually happen before i get off topic let 's look at some logical facts money and value are imaginary ideas that we give to certain attributes of life of course one is the physical manifestation of the other money is supposed to equal value how do we determine value \? there are three main reasons that i can think of 1 rareness \( as in gold or diamonds \) these are just elements arranged in certain patterns that we give value to mostly for aesthetic appeal they are both useful in other ways , but this is not normally valued over aesthetic appeal , thus diamonds cost fucking a lot 2 the next is effort money is meant to be a measure of effort that can be traded amongst others for their effort i think this is a good thing , but at the same time it makes me sad large hunks of metal decorate college campuses all over as sculptures that could have been put to use as cars or something else , yet they are valued more for they 're aesthetic appeal \( see example 1 \) despite this waste , \( and many others \) money is a good system it measures our irrational and rational feelings towards certain things , and we can exchange our effort for what we value with a neutral measurement of currency 3 originality this may be a new invention or a new idea that we have our evolution given foresight to value it is also in a sense rare like example one it may also require a great deal of effort like example two thus originality is valuable \( a quick side note do n't confuse this with harmful original ideas like cannibalism or religion they are both original but neither is truly helpful , if not completely detrimental \) what am i getting at \? money and sustainability ! that supposed measure of effort that we have to trade for the things we want the more we print the less it 's worth \( the less rare , the less valuable i e if gold was everywhere we would have no value for it after all it 's everywhere \) actually then maybe it would be valued for what it 's actually good for the point is that , if we have a standard for the measure of effort to pay for the things we want , and need this standard cannot be allowed to change what good is a standard for measurement if it can be changed at inconsistent intervals \? this leaves no measure if obama is willing to stop changing the standard of effort , i e stop printing money then yes i would be willing to give him a second term , however this seems unlikely he seems to want to use a scalpel because he does n't have the balls to use an axe when needed he can print more money and the standard will change in amounts of numbers , but the effort does not change ! the effort will remain the same or most likely grow stronger regardless , if not because of , the variable change in the measure of effort i e speculation in the trading of currency \( measure of effort \) on the stock market as well as deep questioning about the worth of everything when a standard changes , all that were measured by that standard must be re evaluated once again i say the answer to the question is a matter of how he handles the standard of money and how sustainable it stays as a measure of effort but i remain skeptical i will elaborate further if i even get a reply to this argument","i hope you do n't mind , but i 'd like to follow up your lengthy argument with a lengthy redress while it is true that we do not know who will face off against pres obama , we can have a pretty good idea any of the republican candidates mentioned so far , palin , pawlenty , huckabee , are more right than bush or obama , but they have managed to build small contingents of vehement supporters some of the possible candidates still question pres obama 's citizenship that is simply ignorance i would hate to see the country fall back into the lap of an embarrassingly inept executive now i cannot argue that pres obama is much different than the last president mr bush should not be defended for he was a reckless spender \( medicaid , bail out \) , drove us into two extended wars , led us into massive debt , was utterly divisive , and spoke much more like ford than lincoln or clinton for that matter has obama \( stimulus package , health care , war in libya \) done much to differentiate himself from his predecessor \? i ca n't say that he has however , we would at least have the possibility of change with a democrat in office republicans are called conservatives for a reason what our government needs to do is tackle the core issues that no one is willing to address the poverty gap and incarceration rates i 'll briefly address part of the poverty gap issue by looking at the top money earners in our country the extension of the bush tax cuts for the wealthy , enacted by a democratic controlled congress in december with the approval of the obama administration , pumps 700 billion over the next ten years into the pockets of the rich reclaiming two years of that tax windfall would eliminate all of the state budget deficits combined total compensation at wall street banks and securities firms last year hit a record 135 billion , according to an analysis by the wall street journal , on all time high revenue of 417 billion the recipients of the wall street bailout could bail out the states out of their own pockets the 400 richest individuals in the united states dispose of a staggering 1 37 trillion in assets , an average of nearly 3 5 billion apiece a levy of 10 percent on the resources of these billionaires would also erase the deficits of all 50 states us corporations are currently sitting on 2 trillion in cash , refusing to hire workers despite collecting tax cuts that are supposed to be incentives to do so a levy of 10 percent on that idle cash would provide enough money to eliminate not only the deficits of the states , but the deficits of all cities and local governments too , as well as preserving the jobs of hundreds of thousands of public employees hedge funds assets rose to 1 92 trillion in 2010 , the highest ever , up from 1 18 trillion at the beginning of the year given a standard earnings formula of 2 percent of total assets plus 20 percent of the increase , hedge fund bosses stood to collect roughly 186 billion in personal income an 80 percent tax on that incomeless than the percentage rate on multimillionaires levied under the eisenhower administrationwould produce more than enough revenue to put all 50 states in the black \( it should be pointed out that the top hedge fund manager , john paulson , had a personal net profit of more than 5 billion in 2010 , while more than a dozen hedge fund bosses had personal incomes above 2 billion and many more took in over 1 billion \) this is a small portion of the discrepancies i have n't mentioned the top paid ceos of the big six health insurance providers for that information i suggest looking at the sick for profit website that 's why i think we should stick with obama no matter who opposes him , unless it 's someone like russ feingold or bernie sanders then i 'd go with sanders",-1,+1,0

it borrows it , which means it comes out of the economys left pocket there is no increase in what keynesians refer to as aggregate demand keynesianism doesnt boost national income , it merely redistributes it jobs 3 when the government attempts to create a job , all of these natural forces are removed the market has produced no demand for the government created job in other words , no buyer has voluntarily agreed to purchase those services , because to do so under current market conditions would be unprofitable were it profitable to hire someone to do the government created job , an employer would have done so voluntarily so , the government steps in and forces the taxpayer to purchase those services against his will in additional to violating the taxpayers rights , the entire coordination that existed between employer , employee , and consumer is disrupted jobs 4 to illustrate further , this is what government does to destroy wealth or job creation because it thinks it can create jobs and wealth watch video i agree \( more or less \) with the healthcare reforms , his overturning of policies involving embryonic stem cells , the matthew shepard and james byrd , jr hate crimes prevention act , do n't ask , do n't tell repeal act of 2010 and his ending of the war in iraq more insurance is n't going to contain costs in premiums and deductibles it is only going be more expensive when you buy a car , you pay for what you get if you want a mercedes e class , you have to pay for it compared to a ford fiesta more coverage more money this is what the bill does , just more insurance as for embryonic stem cells , it should be left to private research polo 's cure was invented by a private scientist , not government , where in the goodness of his heart , he donated it without patents for profit as for do n't ask , do n't tell repeal , we will see how effective it is in the years to come one way or another , i do n't care military recruitment should be non compulsive and open to anyone regardless why does the government need to even know your sexual orientation \? why red tape ! ! that is irrelevant to a solider because only libertarians support doing nothing as massive businesses go bankrupt and take their employees and investors with them again , you are an odd creature , you absolutely chastise business because it is inherently corrupt and greedy , but get all sympathetic for big business when they go bankrupt because of bad management where is your sympathy for when small bushiness goes out of business \?

return of fallen soldiers to dover afb the media is now permitted to do so pending adherence to respectful rules and approval of fallen soldier 's family good 1 the white house and federal government

promote in sourcing to bring jobs back good 1 ended the previous practice of protecting credit card companies in place of it are new consumer protections from credit card industry 's predatory practices good 1 energy producing plants must begin preparing to produce 15 of their energy from renewable sources not government 's job 1 lower drug costs for seniors not government 's job 1 ended the previous practice of forbidding medicare from negotiating with drug manufacturers for cheaper drugs the federal government is now realizing hundreds of millions in savings good 1 increasing pay and benefits for military personnel mccain would have done something similar 1 improved housing for military personnel mccain would have done something similar 1 initiating a new policy to promote federal hiring of military spouses mccain would have done something similar 1 improved conditions at walter reed military hospital and other military hospitals mccain would have done something similar 1 increasing student loans not government 's job , not only that but they have failed to address growing tuition costs which negates the benefits of increasing loans 1 increasing opportunities in americorps program ehhh , sure , i like this one 1 sent envoys to middle east and other parts of the world that had been neglected for years reengaging in multilateral and bilateral talks and diplomacy good 1 established a new cyber security office and now he wants the government to be able to take control of the internet in case of emergency 1 beginning the process of reforming and

operations , etc new president , new policy 1 ended previous policy of awarding no bid defense contracts good 1 ordered a review of hurricane and natural disaster preparedness sounds like something any president would do 1 established a national performance officer charged with saving the federal government money and making federal operations more efficient 1 students struggling to make college

house he threw a jewish party \? that 's an accomplishment \? 1 attempting to reform the nation 's healthcare system which is the most expensive in the world yet leaves almost 50 million without health insurance and millions more under insured already listed 1 has put the ball in play for comprehensive immigration reform states are passing their own laws because they are tired of inaction at federal level 1 has announced his intention to push for energy reform i was n't aware that simply announcing a plan was an accomplishment and since this is the kos what they mean by reform is cap and

push for education reform i was n't aware that simply announcing a plan was an accomplishment","because everyone who disagrees with you must not be involved in reality no , you can disagree i'm talking about the ridiculous hatred as evidenced by the tag fuck him and basically every insane tea party 1 okay so you hate him for taxes he has n't raised that makes sense 2 the f 22 program was n't a kick in the balls at all it was a billion dollar program for planes the military does not use only kept alive because senators in respective states that made the planes have been too week to support cutting the program and that the rate of our deficit increase has slowed since obama took office , and our gdp increased 3 it will actually bring everyone 's cost down , including those who pay for it , including you if you pay for it under the current system we pay the most , including you , for the 33rd ranked healthcare in the world it is a retarded system and had to be changed and obama has been the only president strong enough to do such 4 again , so in spite of the chart i linked clearly showing the job situation has steadily improved since obama has been in office , you choose to hate him based on some vague future fear fully imagined in your fevered head and i'm sure you blame bush 's job loss on clinton , makes perfect sense 5 wow , that 's amazing , do n't let other conservatives hear you give him credit for something , they 'll lynch or pray for your soul or exorcise you or some other crazy ass thing next section this is to point out that he 's doing stuff not assoiciated with sacrificing kittens to satan or speaking to hitler 's ghost about ways of turning america into a socialist nation \( that does n't make sense on purpose \) and that it is nice to have a president not born into it and who actually has a clue what he 's doing and since you do agree on some things , i'm not going through point by point unless you have something specific you would like

obama,"those two links do n't say that he 's lying , they say that he 's misrepresenting information which as my second link shows is the case for both knoller and the people who attack knoller they speak against the validness of the article , and portray good arguments considering there is a lot of problems with the sources of information in regards to this issue , i feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent keynsian economics is not the consensus many believe that increased spending is never a good idea , especially under a recession letting the largest of corporations fail is not only supported by right wing economists but by even some of the left wing revolutionaries \( occupy wall street \) i'm not even talking about how to get out of a recession , i'm talking about the very necessities of his office in a recession , were millions become unemployed , he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of us presidents just in unemployment benefits , keeping the people alive and i have no one argue that government spending should be high in a boom , such as bush did , the second highest debt creator bush had reasons , including the war and humanitarian aid for africa and india \( yeah people forget about that part for some weird reason \) i disagree with bush 's fiscal policies as well as obama 's the war was his choice to enter , and considering the flaky reasons for it , i do not give him any relapse on the trillions it cost considering the us' abysmal foreign aid \( as a percentage of national income \) history , its effects are miniscule on such large amounts of money obama supports the bush tax cuts he did not try to end them in any way he said he would not have signed the bill if it did not include other extensions of relief that were also set to expire among other provisions , he cited the extensions of unemployment benefits and tuition tax credits , as well as new tax incentives for businesses obama acknowledged that there are some elements of this legislation that i do n't like , and some that congressional republicans and democrats do n't like that 's the nature of compromise , yielding on something each of us cares about to move forward on what all of us care about , he said and right now , what all of us care about is growing the american economy and creating jobs for the american people but yes , i 'll concede , i was n't aware of that however , considering the whole buffet tax debate \( estimated to save 47 billion by 2022 \) , i would disagree even romney wishes to use the ryan plan , which would save at least 5 trillion dollars ryan 's plans were the ones that led to this recession \( yes , he designed bush 's budget too \) considering the widespread criticism of his plan , i would hesitate before supporting it , yet alone attaching such massive claims to it it 's not just about cutting spending , ron paul wishes to eliminate most federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold this is what annoys me about ron paul some of his policies are fantastic , ending the war on drugs terror , all that bullshit , but at the same time , he applies his unconventional ideals to everything , and it would just be a bad thing overall but , that 's unrelated how are they hurting the people it helps social support is supposed to help those who need it the most reducing spending on social support , and taxation , increases inequality , and disproportionately affects the poor","i feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent good thing i provided the second link to show how it 's still relevant in a recession , were millions become unemployed , he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of us presidents just in unemployment benefits , keeping the people alive even if you want to use the expense of welfare argument , that is not nearly the amount that went up in spending under the obama administration unless corporate welfare counts as well , military spending and increased subsidies for various businesses and continued bank support , provisions for various organizations more importantly , the unnecessary welfare spending that continues to rise but provide no benefit but only to create government dependence all of this at the expense of small businesses that try to compete with large businesses in a heavily regulated market the war was his choice to enter , one that obama continues , and even expanded by bombing libya and progressing the disaster in pakistan buffet tax debate \( estimated to save 47 billion by 2022 \) , i would disagree which will do practically nothing to cover the costs that he continues to spike it 's a red herring ryan 's plans were the ones that led to this recession i was referring to his proposal on healthcare , not something a decade ago \( that actually also led to economic prosperity if it was n't for the war , bush would have a much better legacy in economics \) he applies his unconventional ideals to everything , and it would just be a bad thing overall his ideas are consistent and rational the 're based on expanding wealth and diminishing most government powers that have put us here in the first place people seem to act like government is so important that it 's okay to allow it to choose winners and losers \( as it has done through regulations and restrictions \) ron paul and other libertarian thinkers believe that individuals benefit the most when they have choice over what to do with their own property reducing spending on social support , and taxation , increases inequality , and disproportionately affects the poor is this why welfare reform resulted in economic prosperity \? is this why fdr almost made the depression worse until the war started \? if there is any kind of spending that has ever helped economy and the prosperity of citizens it has historically been military spending yet that is one of the many things that government has boosted its spending in , and even so , just because military has been successful in the past does n't mean that it 's the only way even so , helping those who truly ca n't help themselves is still a small portion of government spending edit the soviet union had industrial progression , but this was also , technically , military spending as for their agriculture , 27 of the food provided for the people was from private farm owners , even though they took up 1 of the total agricultural community of russia historically , as we see , overall wealth goes up with privatization , no with government welfare i agree that some welfare may still be necessary for those who need it most , but at the rate it is now \( and how both obama and romney want to continue it

the presidency has exactly no control over the gas prices i would suggest reading this oil prices are a global phenomena you have no point when president bush left office \( not that this is low \) the national debt was 8 trillion 10 trillion you have already discredited your argument today it 's 15 trillion 's and climbing but why \? why is climbing \? it 's obama is n't it that nazi always spending money except it is n't obama 's policy it 's bush 's that is driving up the debt almost all of our deficit can be attributed to four main spending binges 1 two unsustainable useless wars started , passed , and continued by republicans it took obama to end iraq and create an endgame for afghanistan pullout 2 two unsustainable , deficit exploding tax cuts for the rich all passed , initiated , pushed , and signed by republicans 3 an unsustainable social security increase take a guess as to who passed it \?

no obama has killed 22 of 30 top al qaeda heads how many did bush get in 8 years \? 4 obama has been by far the best commander in chief in modern american history taxes , conservatives want them low and liberals want them high wrong righties want taxes for working people , the poor and middle class \( who have seen income increases of 5 in the past 30 years \) to be high and cut taxes for the rich who have seen income increases of 212 in the past 30 years liberals realize this is incredibly unfair and that income inequality is vicious , self perpetuating cycle that needs to stop 50 of americans pay no taxes at all ! that is a lie stop being spoon fed republican bullshit lies and propaganda they pay sales tax property tax estate tax social security payroll taxes etc the wealthy pay their fair share they do not raising taxes is one thing but if the president is going to raise them he needs to raise them on everyone when has obama ever raised taxes \? he cut taxes for small businesses 16 times extended the bush tax cut fought against republicans to extend patrol tax cuts and won his jobs plan was over 50 tax cuts his stimulus cut taxes for 95 of americans he wants to cut corporate taxes from 35 to 28 the corporate tax actual rate \( average percent paid about 12 , not the 35 the right whines about \) is the lowest in decades under obama but no he wants to raise taxes you righties will just never stop smearing this president with lies will you \?

we do n't need fossils screwing up progress due to their old prejudices looks like someone has a conspiracy , someone who does n't engage in conspiracies that controversy is as accurate as the obama not born in america","answer these questions how is government funded \? does government possess any assets without taxation \? does government have any financial authority without taxation \? technically speaking our government owns nothing because it is public , however practically speaking it owns its institutions and their collective works does a business have any financial authority without charging a bill \? in other words , speaking in the context of our discussion , taxation and a private bill are practically the same government is funded by private citizens in an capitalist economy government has no assets so none of the taxation is generated by its own means it does n't matter if a business generates income by itself , it matters if it generates it by exchange with others there is no transfer because government prohibits these types of jobs to the private sector by law does not change the fact that they are not transferred jobs , but created ones again , you only presume government is the only entity that can provide certain services the private sector is may be unable to provide a service because of the laws prohibiting competition such as nasa or usps only the wealthiest oil corporations could hope to touch our military budget , and yet they fall short by about half that is to say nothing of medical research , aerospace research and engineering , and physics research like the lhc which are all in addition to the military budget all of the employees who work at nasa or defense , whose money is it that they are using are these organizations self funded through their own personal money \? , no because the employees whom work at these places are funded by taxation , who is paid by private citizens government employees taxes are just recycled into the system because their source of money can from the private sector it is government taking from private citizens they use their own money , which comes from providing a service to the public \( taxes \) , through trade of goods \( technology to the private sector and other governments \) there is no such as as surplus wealth if government accounts for 40 of the 100 of the economy , that means that 60 of the economy must provide for 100 of the people because 40 is being transferred from private to public it really is n't that simple , because a portion of that 40 is often made accessible to the people in the form of student aid , welfare , unemployment , social security , schools , medicine , etc the other 60 as utilised by the private sector is never distributed in a manner approaching equality and that is why you have one percent of the people holding fourty percent of it \( which would mean as per your numbers that 1 of the people hold 16 of the nation 's economy in their hands \) to answer your actual question however , what i mean by surplus wealth is that wealth which is beyond the living means of the owner for instance , lets say i am a private citizen and you are government i produce 100 dollars of the entire economy in our world for 100 of the population , so you impose a tax of 5 , so now i only have 95 dollars next , you say that you will create more jobs where are you going to get it \? well , me because you do n't possess any assets so , you impose a tax of 10 , now , i only have 90 dollars now , you want more government jobs , impose 25 , now , i only have 75 dollars so , now , i have to support our economy on only 75 dollars where it was 100 because 25 are being diverted to the public sector it 's the same exact issue with private companies if you have 100 dollars , and this is the total gdp , and a business charges you 5 for medicine , you now have 95 and the business has 5 the business did not increase the gdp to 105 conservation of wealth , like conservation of energy milton milton i never cared for milton friedman 's opinion he 's a bit of a nutter this only shows your lack of knowledge of keynesian economics it is not about fixing social problems keynesian economics is merely the idea that government can intervene to stimulate the market where it is acting with reduced efficiency because private entrepreneurs use their own money by saving and invest or if they borrow money , then they pay it back , government does n't use its own money because it does n't have any of its own , so any money it borrows , neither are they paying it back with your own money , that burden is put onto the shoulders of taxpayers you just explained how a government uses tax , and the behaviours surrounding government borrowing what i'm interested in is the fundamental changing of hands which both sales and taxes employ and that money is who money does it belong to it would be the government 's money , since they provided a service and you are paying for it it 's how corporatism works in democracy same thing healthcare coverage is so poor because it is rationed care not driven by market forces , but you want government run health care where even more ration care will emerge the healthcare act is not socialised medicine it is private medicine , which means that the rationed care you speak of is a capitalist phenomenon well , they cured polio but your going to cry over the few for the many remember you are a big advocate for greater good polio was a life threatening disease , and it is gone it is a matter of the welfare of the few , for the many because right now those bad ethics are wildly illegal if they were not , it would n't be the few any longer but a large number of annual deaths and deformities caused by standard medical research practice there is nowhere where government has done better than private industry if so , because government has no competition , nasa , usps \( first class mail \) , and education most of them you hardly notice roads , research , technological development , military , police , courts also government put a man on the moon and a probe on mars what has big business done for you \? why do you keep assuming i applaud bush \? those laws hurt non profit search as well as your government research i do n't despite your sentiments for the little guy , you are because no matter how much of a complete failure management was , you think that they should be bailed out those workers would just find different jobs just wait until you get fired or laid off from your career at age fifty , and are desperate to find work for almost a year but no one hires you because you 're old and they want new , young professionals you really have no empathy for these people because you 're too self absorbed one other detail since many thousands of them would be laid off , this means that the market would be suddenly flooded with people who have the same credentials , which means they would probably receive lower salaries on top of losing their retirement i am certain that one man , branson , will be able to provide space travel for any paying customer instead of the select few the government picks maybe , space travel may become as inexpensive that anyone will be able to fly and experience it i'm not as hopeful , look at airline security and how often a plane crashes i can just imagine the skies being littered with thousands of bodies due to cost cutting and terrorists",-1,+1,0

obama,"the first article is not false \? why then , why i search the authors name in google , do i see , on the first page , two articles specifically stating that he 's wrong when it comes to debt obama \? links 1 2 i liked your second article more , it seemed less biased , and it did raise two good points first of all , obama is supposed to spend more in a recession , government spending should counter the business cycle bush had no real reason to continue the deficit in the way that he should have , whilst obama had the biggest recession in modern history to get back to your original point , of how obama has increased debt more than any other president , i was simply pointing out that it 's hardly a fair comparison second of all , obama 's tried to increase tax on the upper classes , and the corporations , and been blocked by republicans again , it 's hardly fair to call him 'the worst president ever' when the results you are using against him are not of his own making but , as i said originally , i do n't think obama deserves all of the love that he gets from the 'left' liberals democrats , whatever you want to call them he is currently the best of a bad lot i remember looking through the official comparisons of the various candidates economic projections , and yes , it is true that ron pauls cut the deficit most quickly , and therefore debt , but it did so at the expense of the economy the libertarians look to 'save' the economy , but at the expense of the people who it is supposed to help , and this is where i feel that obama does well , and the republicans do neither","those two links do n't say that he 's lying , they say that he 's misrepresenting information which as my second link shows is the case for both knoller and the people who attack knoller obama is supposed to spend more in a recession keynsian economics is not the consensus many believe that increased spending is never a good idea , especially under a recession letting the largest of corporations fail is not only supported by right wing economists but by even some of the left wing revolutionaries \( occupy wall street \) bush had no real reason to continue the deficit in the way that he should have bush had reasons , including the war and humanitarian aid for africa and india \( yeah people forget about that part for some weird reason \) i disagree with bush 's fiscal policies as well as obama 's obama 's tried to increase tax on the upper classes , and the corporations , and been blocked by republicans obama supports the bush tax cuts he did not try to end them in any way it 's hardly fair to call him 'the worst president ever' i already pointed out that that title belongs to jimmy carter he is currently the best of a bad lot even romney wishes to use the ryan plan , which would save at least 5 trillion dollars and if romney were to use ryan 's earlier plans , healthcare would be solved and spending would be moderately decreased even more however , the ryan plan is not as good as it should be it is true that ron pauls cut the deficit most quickly , and therefore debt , but it did so at the expense of the economy it 's not just about cutting spending , ron paul wishes to eliminate most federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold federal spending and regulation is what got us here in the first place the war on drugs , the war on terror , the federal reserve , etc obama is just another politician with the same bs that bush brought us the idea that people truly believe him to be a candidate of change is , at times , frustrating the libertarians look to 'save' the economy , but at the expense of the people who it is supposed to help how are they hurting the people it helps federal manipulation of the economy has only led us to here once again , the problem is big government we put so much faith into a group of people who think that manipulation and control of free individuals is the answer it 's a hegemony of slavery",+1,-1,0

obama,"let 's see , saved the auto industry , got osama in 2 5 years after the last republican could n't in nearly 7 , jobs and gdp have increased consistently every month he 's been president , while they both had decreased every single month just about for nearly 7 years before he was elected plus a president finally brave enough to fix our ridiculous health care system besides , republicans are too puritan and uneducated at their base to elect anyone who has even a passive chance of beating obama this time around you 're going end up with a nominee who thinks adam and eve ran around with dinosaurs , thinks global warming is a hoax , and wo n't be able to answer a single substance question unless it 's on fox and they are given the script beforehand republicans really do n't have a chance this time , and after the silliness in wisconsin dems have a really good chance of taking back the house as well it is fun watching your nominees jump in and out of the race jeez i hope palin runs , that would be hilarious",hey stupid he helped the auto industry with taxpayers dollars ! hellllooooo \? and thats helping the american people how \? chrysler will never pay it back in our lifetimes seriously you make no sense !,+1,-1,0
obama,thinking of the election that was placed you either had to choose from a very old republican canadiate who pretty much followed the steps of bush which probably would not work also god forbid if mccain died and palin was president thats a disaster on the other hand you had a very liberal president and people wanted change and they need it but now obama is now president and the media settled down on having a black president \( correction half black no1 ever picks that up \) implying that does not make me racist only aware now america really has n't all and all changed the economy sucks still unemployment is up foreclosure is up i mean i give obama credit he has good ideas but they suck if not putting them to action also bush lost the respect of many foreign countries then obama killed not for personality but just for his race and how a half black man controls a country were the majority is white,"the economy sucks still unemployment is up foreclosure is up i mean i give obama credit he has good ideas but they suck if not putting them to action when obama took office we were losing on average 700 , 000 jobs per month now we 've leveled off gaining some and losing some month to month the reason obama has not done as much as he wanted is because since he took office republicans have raped the filibuster rule prior to obama being president the most any party had used the filibuster in the history of the senate in one year was around a hundred last year republicans filibustered over 200 times that is the only reason he has n't had as much as he would like done that 's not his fault and every president since nixon except bush jr has wanted to pass a healthcare bill every single one obama has been the only president able to , and that in itself is going to put him on par with some great presidents and once this psychotic tea party pout fest ends and republicans come to their senses and start compromising on things , he 'll be able to bring the economy the rest of the way back as well of course though in 6 years republicans will just elect another frat boy or actor to ruin all the hard democratic work again gt lt",-1,+1,0

obama,"things bush did he got us into the unjustified trillion dollar war in iraq that has left a million people dead he spent a lot of money while cutting taxes for the rich , thus exploding our debt he soured our relations with the rest of the world he allowed torture he completely blundered with regard to katrina he worked to tear down the separation between church and state he fired united states attorneys for political reasons truly he was one of the greats ! but the real problem with bush were the things he did n't do he did n't reform our financial system he did n't address global warming he did n't commit enough to afghanistan he did n't address the rising income inequality in america he did n't address health care costs he failed to fix social security he resisted alternative energy he failed on immigration reform he never got bin laden other than that he was ok \)",how do you like the fact he has denied skimmers offered from other countries to help with the oil spill and he wo n't let them because of the jones act \? quote obama said to florida senator florida senator obama told me we cant deploy oil skimmers because they might be needed elsewhere nice ! thats like me calling the fire dept to come to my house and put out the fire because it 's on fire and the fire dept says they ca n't because they might be needed to put a fire out in the future that they do n't know about yet but if they did then they would n't be able to because they would be putting out my fire come on jessald even you can say obama has failed here,+1,-1,0

obama,"your infatuation with obama is either blinding you completely or you are purposely distorting facts tea party weirdos it is weird to believe in constitutional govt if you think they 're weird , give us reasons , or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot \( someone who makes decisions without facts \) this very year is the least taxes americans have paid then at any time during the bush administration ok , i do n't know if this is a purposeful lie or you just do n't see this tax rates have actually gone up for almost everyone paying taxes , but we are in a massive recession , so tax revenue is down your statement is true but is a huge manipulation of fact ironically , your point only proves why the bush tax cuts should be extended by lowering taxes for certain income brackets , the govt tax revenue actually goes up 2 spending has actually been cut no sure he cut the f 22 program , but the stimulus bill , health care , and a myriad of other programs have skyrocketed federal spending this is just not true sorry 3 every nation that has ever passed a healthcare plan similar to the one obama passed was happy for it so if everyone else is doing it we should too \? most of these countries are having financial meltdowns because of massive deficit spending 4 due to the stimulus package , the economy is improving here is a jobs chart link and that is actually off , we actually gained 200 , 000 jobs in january the most recent numbers indicate again , no first of all , 200 , 000 jobs gained in january are census jobs mostly second , the stimulus package contained almost no stimulus it cannot stimulate the economy because it was almost entirely pork barrel spending and was stimulus in name only that aside , we have clearly lost jobs , as unemployment has gone from 6 to 10 where did that 700 billion dollars go \? and even if we did add jobs , 700 billion for 200k jobs \? it would be cheaper to give 1 million dollars to every american anyway , i'm gonna skim and end , because i think i 've made my point 1 ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending political double speak while he drastically increases spending he attempts to make himself look good by ordering reviews 1 ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices see above 1 instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible while bills like the 1 trillion dollar health care bill are done completely behind closed doors 1 limits on lobbyist 's access to the white house he said but we have seen the heaviest lobbying in white house history under his regime anyway , point being almost everything this man touches turns to dust the budget neutral health care bill has now been revealed by the cbo to be a 1 trillion dollar deficit we are spending 150 of our gdp in deficit spending \( greece is collapsing at only 119 \) he passed student loan reform and no one even knows what it means you say this man will go down in history this is undoubtedly true he will go down as the man who in four years decimated the us economy","i'm not infatuated at all , in fact i think he has been too moderate but i'm not a retard who lives in an alternate universe where obama has horns he 's doing a really good job especially considering what he was left with it is weird to believe in constitutional govt if you think they 're weird , give us reasons , or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot \( someone who makes decisions without facts \) and exactly what part of the constitution has obama not followed \? that is why they are weird , they live under a number of delusions , that the government has been acting unconstitutionally only one of many here are some of the other tea party delusions 1 obama was not born here 2 obama is taking your guns when in fact he 's relaxed gun laws 3 obama has raised their taxes , when in fact everyone paid less taxes last year 4 only poor black people who want free stuff voted for him even though he won by one of the largest majorities in history i'm sure there are more but i try not to talk to the village idiots anyway , yes , on average every one really did pay less taxes i realize that ruins many of those potato chip stuffed asses reason for leaving their recliner and making a colorful sign , but it is the truth further , half the idiot tea party crying about gov'ment tooks my money ! wah ! actually benefit from one government program or another , and would be crying even harder if the government took away their medicare or social security 2 no , spending really has been cut the stimulus was passed under bush , and under obama most of the money has been repaid it 's yet another silly tea bagger delusion , this idea that only obama passed the stimulus , and that the stimulus is n't the only thing that saved us from another great depression every expert says without it we would be living in hoover tents right now anyway , part of the problem i see , is that people like yourself when i say spending has been cut you are comparing spending now , to spending in magical fairy land , while i on the other hand am dealing with reality , and the spending during the bush years 3 uh , no every country that has a similar plan , and usually an even more liberal plan than what was passed here , spends less per capita on healthcare that means they have more money that means they are less likely to have financial meltdowns due to healthcare again , you do not argue in reality look at any chart of healthcare spending and you will see the us spent nearly twice as much as any country before this was passed 4 oh my god , are you literally retarded \? i mean i had my suspicions when i saw your name , looks like a gay dating site title , but that aside i did n't really think you were literally retarded until i saw your number 4 point there bush was handed the best economy in the history of the us due to clinton 's policies this massive surplus was literally squandered by that monkey bush in about 3 years due to what you call stimulus which is really just tax cuts for people who do n't need them and wo n't put the money back into the economy and insane deregulation that started with reagan , we went from the greatest us economy in history to the second worst in us history it is truly an accomplishment in itself , how one crappy president with daddy issues can bring an entire economy to it 's knees so quickly now we have an intelligent person in office , and for the first time in about 6 years each month is showing less job losses than the last , and in some instances actual job gains , and still you preach bush era economic strategy it is truly mind boggling how one can be so completely clueless honestly i'm bored of you now i will add though to your bigot comment you do realize that if obama were not black this fake corporate run grass roots tea bagger bs would not happen sure some are just clueless idiots who live in a faux noise media alternate universe and have no idea how backwards their view of what is going on is , but most are pissed because real america as they put it , in there view does not include black people disliking people because of their opinions is far different than comparing a democratically elected president to hitler and insisting he was not born here all because of the color of his skin and i do n't want to hear the old line no that 's not it uh , uh , it 's his policies bullshit where was the tea party in the clinton years \?

obama,he was the only one that really ever tried to fix social security his plan was awesome for social security but like typical government most libs who scorned it do n't like to give money back to the people it belonged too like me or you his plan would have gone into a mutual fund or annuity and you would have been guaranteed that money at 59 5 years of age unlike right now where we probably wont get it and you have to be 62 bush signed into office on of the most aggressive bills for auto emissions in the history of all presidents bush did things i do n't like but when i hear the media and people like you throwing out stuff like that you have to go deeper than just whats being said i agree with you on the firing attorney thing bush was not a true conservative that i like he also signed no child left behind which is a disaster and was to try to bring down government run schools his reform on illegals was horrible and so is obamas,"well if you 're going to give bush credit for things he wanted to do , then you have to give obama credit for things he wants to do universal health care , clean energy research , financial reform , and closing guantanamo \) i 'll give you the auto bill thing , i had forgotten about that but still , that was the bare minimum bush rejected the kyoto protocol , which was the thing that mattered the most by far with respect to global warming",-1,+1,0
