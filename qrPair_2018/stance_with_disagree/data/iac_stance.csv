even if that worked the u s , like russia and a few other nuclear powers , keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over , and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army so it would never happen that the u s would be left nuclear naked but lets assume that happened \( maybe during a really , really cool party some xxxxx colonel peed on them , and they just fried \) the genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air , ground and sea you still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the u s probably spend several trillion doing it \( i know , thats a pretty low number for the invasion of america \) , and in that case most likely have satellites and long range missiles \( again lets assume somehow americas own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all americas nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event \) the hugest , most glaring problem with the militia , unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop , they would have to gather and if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in , to order to defeat the large invading army , they would be taken out very easily by 1 icbms launched from enemy subs 2 prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1 5 mile range and superb training and intelligence \( remember those satellites \) 3 all groups preparing for battle so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars , ambushes , rockets , infantry rushes , tank columns etc before they knew what hit them 4 it would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight , and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability , they would still need satellites for the military genius in california to command units in n y , n y , and wait americas satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that , it would n't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit \( effectively sitting ducks \) and any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection but militia units only have guns , and they would get their butts whooped , even with massive numbers what you are saying is only true about napoleonic tactics , in todays modern warfare almost completely infantry based armies are obsolete and very venerable no the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint , the terrain was different , the people are more hardened , the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the russians , the afghans had unlimited anti tank reserves , had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide , plan and attack , only had to defeat , on the majority , other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross , the russians were under funded and their moral low , the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking soviet empire , china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence , afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back up by the very crappy russian naval forces , the afghans received help from the rest of the arab world which would not happen with the u s because if an enemy can take out the u s , it could probably take out the combined forces of europe and north america , and , finally , the afgans did n't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands , but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan , the americans would be defended their homeland neither is the french revolution a good counter point , as i have said , your tactics only work with napoleonic style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when napoleon the 3rd was in power \? \( in case you did n't learn it in school , napoleon the 3rd , napoleon 's nephew , was in power during the french revolution \) trust me , cause the only thing i love more then physics is military tactics and warfare as i have shown in more detail , treat2 is right , it would n't work the other amendments do n't pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the u s a , they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and in fashion so long as the u s still has human citizens please opinions only , not baseless assumptions using limited military knowledge , or rebuttals to previous opinions","so , in your opinion , are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about , would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the usa are armed to the teeth or not in their pre war planning \?

took it out of context here is dr olsen 's letter in it 's entirety national museum of natural history smithsonian institution washington , d c 20560 1 november 1999 open letter to dr peter raven , secretary praven nas org committee for research and exploration national geographic society washington , dc 20036 dear peter , i thought that i should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the national geographic society with the publication of feathers for t rex \? by christopher p sloan in its november issue , national geographic has reached an all time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism but at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature although it is possible that mr czerkas will later name the specimen identified on page 100 as archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so because this latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full spread photograph of the specimen accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , the name archaeoraptor liaoningensis sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in national geographic \( international code of zoological nomenclature , article 13a , i \) this is the worst nightmare of many zoologists that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist clearly , national geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that the czerkases now plan to return it to china in washington , in june of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th international meeting of the society of avian paleontology and evolution , held at the smithsonian institution , were signatories to a letter to the director of the chinese academy of sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from china and encouraged the chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation there were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message thus , at least since mid 1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from liaoning offered for sale outside of china are contraband most , if not all , major natural history museums in the united states have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin the national geographic society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions prior to the publication of the article dinosaurs take wing in the july 1998 national geographic , lou mazzatenta , the photographer for sloan 's article , invited me to the national geographic society to review his photographs of chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story at that time , i tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what national geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that national geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that makes the news rather than reporting it his bald statement that we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing this melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned more importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact the statement on page 103 that hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical the hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the national geographic society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers a model of the undisputed dinosaur deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction the idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at nature and national geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion if sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken but it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , national geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode sincerely , storrs

229@6,so much for 'genetic altruism',well not exactly the article addresses some commonality in humans and chimps with regard to altruism exhibited toward chimpanzees who are not known to the chimp exhibiting the behavior the point was to draw a possible parallel between human altrusim which is known to go beyond mere kinship selection and the chimp behaviors which also appear to go beyond kinship selection the discussion goes to the fact that humans and chimps share a common ancestor at the point where humans and chimps went their separate evolutionary pathways one possibility is that such a common ancestor may have had the capacity to also be altruistic to individuals outside its kinship group or of course that chimps and humans both developed their respective altruistic behaviors independently after the branch point none of this negates the concept of biological altruism in the form of kinship selection which a geneticall based effect indeed the article recognizes that chimps do exhibit kinship selection effects ! there is of course no reason at al that one cannot have kinship selection as well as other motivators for altruistic behavior so its rather premature to take kinship selection \( which i think is what ww means by genetic altruisim \) off the table just yet the article certainly does not draw the same conclusions as ww would have it do once more the rabbit hops over the actual work to his own preferred conclusion sop for the lagomorph,evolution,0,1,0,0

396@6,"i think its finally settled that physical \( testable or tangible \) evidence of god can never be found this is not only because of its elusive nature to science , but also because of religious requirements from a scientic perspective , nothing ever occurs outside of the realm of phyical law that is , physical laws are constant and unbreakable , and there is nothing new or unpredictable or inexplicable about them because the laws of physics completely govern ever aspect of the universe , there is nothing left for a supernatural being to do , at least where the phsical realm is concerned there is no supernatural phenomenon , and no occurance that natural physical laws do not affect from a religious perspective , knowledge of god can only come through faith we already know that faith is certainty in the absence of rational evidence , in other word believing without evidence hebrews 11 6 says and without faith it is impossible to please him for whoever would draw near to god must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him faith is the key to religion , and only through faith can religion be established therefore , if some physical observation could verify god 's existence , then it would contradict what religion says about god this is a real catch 22 you search for evidence to solidify your faith , but if evidence comes you dont need faith , and without faith you cannot relate to god in all , as far as i'm concrned , it is totally futile to seek rational proof of god 's existence even if it was found , it wouldnt be found i remember saying that it is possible to prove that god exists that is , in the event that god showed up and said hey , it 's me ! but even this can never happen , because such a scenario would contradict the bible , and thus not prove god exists as far as the bible is concerned and when all is said and done , it still doesnt answer the question does god exist \?","but then it also does n't answer the question does anything exist , nor does it answer an infinite number of existence questions do trolls exist , follows the same reasoning if you find one , they are no longer a fairy tale imaginary creature , they are some organic life form that can be measured , tested , and quantified i e no longer an imaginary creature so they can no more be found than god so replace god troll with an infinite number of other imaginary things and you 'll see why the question does god exist \? , has no real importance in the physical universe \( does the tooth fairy exist , does a unicorn exist , do flying pigs exist , etc \) in fact , i like that statement the existence of god is not imporant rather the faith in god \( s , etc \) is what is important , and the thoughts most certainly exist in the physical world and have a measureable impact i think that 's why i do n't mind so much religion per se , it 's the human condition that brings suffering , and uncertainty , into our lives and for some people , the feelings brought about by their faith seems to treat the condition \( the human condition also brings joy , love , etc , but i 'd like that without the pain personally \) i only mind it when things in the physical universe are attacked with the premise of belief in god \( s \) , which is a waste of human energy we have a limited time , do n't spend it using fallacy to undermine those who are actually trying to build on the foundation of human knowledge and any belief in something without evidence scares me if it becomes a driving force behind decisions she 's a witch because she made the crops die she must be burned he broke god 's law and therefore must be guilty this is god 's war yeah , that still scares me that 's why i think , at least in the us , the seperation of church and state is so ridiculously important , and accepted while there are fundamentalists that rail against it it 's hopefully obvious that with 80 of the us believing in an imaginary god , but also having a separation of church and state and the most generally advanced scienctific community in the world , then the two can obviously co exist , and i 'd go so far as to say thrive as long as the line is drawn and not crossed i learned something in responding , thanks for the spark mach",existence of God,0,0,0,1

it is in reality far more restrictive than the expired federal ban ! i dont know if it is being sold as merely a common sense state enactment of the old federal ban that expired and no longer protects us , but if it is , then here is why that argument is fraudulent the old federal ban was far less restrictive because it defined an aw \( in addition to some firearms deemed automatically an aw \) as having 2 or more of the cosmetic features , while this new statute says it needs only 1 cosmetic feature that is a significant difference which allows this proposed law to capture many more firearms

knowing full well it would ban far more firearms if i were you i would let my legislator know this difference for comparison , here are the aw definitions from the old federal aw ban 18 u s c 921 is a listing of how terms are defined in the firearms offenses portion of the code , and it defines a federally banned aw as follows \( 30 \) the term semiautomatic assault weapon means \( a \) any of the

figure why or how it got there other than by way of noah 's flood and here 's a scholarly article from the biblical perspective that points out the different interpretations theologians consider , both conservative and liberal http www grisda org origins 22058 htm biblical evidence for the universality of the genesis flood richard m davidson john nevin andrews professor of old testament interpretation old testament department andrews university , berrien springs , michigan origins 22 \( 2 \) 58 73 \( 1995 \) what this article is about the extent of the genesis flood has been vigorously debated by biblical scholars for those who accept a recent creation week of six literal consecutive , twenty four days , a universal flood is necessary to explain the existence of the geologic column the thesis of this study is that only the traditional interpretation which posits a literal , universal , world wide genesis flood does full justice to all the relevant biblical data the author summarizes twenty two lines of biblical evidence including terminological , thematic , contextual , grammatical syntactical , literary structural , logical conceptual , theological , canonical , and typological which support the universality of the genesis flood please note unfortunately , we are unable to reproduce all of the special accent marks that were present in our printed version of the hebrew transliteration our apologies for any inconvenience this might cause i conflicting schools of interpretation one of the most controversial aspects of the flood narrative concerns the extent of the genesis flood three major positions are taken \( 1 \) the traditional , which asserts the universal , world wide , nature of the deluge \( 2 \) limited or local flood theories , which narrow the scope of the flood story to a particular geographical location in mesopotamia and \( 3 \) non literal \( symbolic \) interpretation , which suggests that the flood story is a non historical account written to teach theological truth against this third position , the non historical , we must note the evidences within the biblical account affirming the historical nature of the flood in the literary structure of the flood story \( see shea 1979 \) , the genealogical frame or envelope construction \( genesis 5 32 and 9 28 29 \) plus the secondary genealogies \( genesis 6 9 10 and 9 18 19 \) are indicators that the account is intended to be factual history the use of the genealogical term tledt \( generations , account \) in the flood story \( 6 9 \) as throughout genesis \( 13 times , structuring the whole book \) , indicates that the author intended this story to be as historically veracious as the rest of genesis \( doukhan 1978 , p 167 220 \) walter kaiser analyzes the literary form of genesis 1 11 and concludes that this whole section of genesis must be taken as historical narrative prose \( kaiser 1970 \) a number of references in the book of job may allude to the then relatively recent flood \( job 9 5 8 12 14 15 14 11 12 22 15 17 26 10 14 28 9 38 8 11 see morris 1988 , p 26 30 \) the historical occurrence of the flood is part of the saving judging acts of god , and its historicity is assumed and essential to the theological arguments of later biblical writers employing flood typology \( see davidson 1981 , p 326 327 \) more on this point later thus according to the biblical writers , far from being a non historical , symbolical , or mythical account written only to teach theological truths , the flood narrative is intended to accurately record a real , literal , historical event for evangelical christians who take seriously the biblical record and accept the historicity of the flood account , the question still remains whether the event described is to be taken as a local , limited flood or a universal , world wide cataclysm the limited flood theories rest primarily on scientific arguments that present seemingly difficult geological , biological , and anthropological problems for a universal flood \( see boardman 1990 , p 212 223 custance 1979 , p 28 58 kidner 1967 , p 93 95 mitchell 1982 1993 ramm 1954 , p 232 249 young 1977 , p 171 210 \) since the scientific argumentation is not the subject of this article , i can only suggest that these problems are not insurmountable , although much more study is needed a number of studies provides a growing body of evidence for diluvial catastrophism as an alternative to conventional long age geology \( see coffin and brown 1983 roth 1985 , 1986a , 1988 whitcomb 1988 baumgardner 1994a , b \) the local flood theories further assert that the terminology describing the extent of the flood should be interpreted in a relative and not absolute universal sense the various seemingly universal terms are regarded as implying only a limited locality they are seen to indicate universality within the writer 's world view but a limited scope in terms of our modern world view \( see boardman 1990 , p 223 226 custance 1979 , p 15 27 kidner 1967 , p 93 95 ramm 1954 , p 241 242 \) we will take up this issue in the next section of this article the traditional conservative understanding of the flood narrative is that genesis 6 9 describes a universal , world wide deluge it should be noted that this is also the view of the majority of liberal critical commentators on genesis 6 9 , although they regard the biblical view as borrowed from the ane accounts and not historical \( see hasel 1975 , p 78 and note 16 for bibliography of representatives of this position fohrer , koehler , noth , procksch , skinner , sarna , speiser , von rad , vriezen , zimmerli , etc some of these and other more recent representatives of this view are cited later in this article \) the thesis of this article is that only the traditional position of a literal , universal world wide flood does full justice to the biblical data , and this universal interpretation is crucial for flood theology in genesis and for the theological implications drawn by later biblical writers ii biblical terminology in genesis 6 9 indicating universality perhaps the most important kind of biblical evidence for a universal flood is the specific all inclusive terminology found within the genesis account itself the late gerhard hasel has provided a careful treatment of this terminology in three penetrating studies in previous issues of origins \( hasel 1974 , 1975 , 1978 \) , and therefore i need not go into detail in this article eight different terms or phrases in genesis 6 9 , most echoing their counterparts in the world wide creation account of genesis 1 2 , indicate universality first , the term haares the earth , occurring 46 times in the flood narrative \( genesis 6 12 , 13 , 17 , etc \) , always without any accompanying genitive of limitation , clearly parallels the usage of the same term in the account of world wide , universal creation in genesis 1 1 , 2 , 10 \( while the term at times elsewhere may be used without a genitive and still in context be limited in scope to a certain land , the explicit link to creation in the flood account \( see especially genesis 6 6 , 7 \) clearly gives a universal context for its usage in genesis 6 9 \) some have argued that if moses had wished to indicate the entire world , he would have used the hebrew term tebel , which means the world as a whole , or dry land in the sense of continents this word is never used in the flood narrative but it should be pointed out that tebel is never used in the entire pentateuch , including the creation account in fact , the term appears no where in the narrative portions of the hebrew bible , but only in poetic texts \( 39 times \) usually as a poetic synonym in parallel with haares the earth thus this argument from silence does not adequately consider the contextual and poetic use of terminology , and carries little weight a second expression , upon the face of all the earth al pen kol haares \( genesis 7 3 8 9 \) , clearly alludes to the first occurrence of the same phrase in the universal context of creation \( genesis 1 29 cf genesis 1 2 for a related universal expression \) , and thus here also implies a universality of the same dimension , i e , the entire surface of the global mass while the shortened term all the earth \( kol haares \) by itself may have a limited meaning elsewhere when indicated by the immediate context \( see exodus 10 5 , 15 numbers 22 5 , 11 1 kings 4 34 10 24 2 chronicles 36 23 genesis 41 57 \) , the immediate context of the flood story is the universal sinfulness of humankind whom god had made and created \( genesis 6 6 , 7 \) to have dominion over all the earth \( genesis 1 26 \) , and the succeeding context is the universal dispersal of man after the tower of babel upon the face of all the earth \( genesis 11 4 , 8 , 9 \) in each of the four occurrences of the phrase upon the face of all the earth in genesis outside the flood story \( genesis 1 29 11 4 , 8 , 9 \) , it clearly has the universal sense of the entire land surface of the globe , and there is nothing in the flood narrative to indicate any less universality \( it should be also noted that the one place in genesis where in context a similar phrase upon all the face of the earth is not universal the famine mentioned in genesis 41 56 , the hebrew has a change in word order from elsewhere in genesis al kol pen haares \) third , the phrase face of the ground pen haadamah \( five times in the flood narrative , 7 4 , 22 , 23 8 8 , 13 \) , occurs in parallel with universal terms we have just noted , the earth \( 7 23 \) and face of all the earth \( 8 9 \) and this phrase face of the ground likewise harks back to its first usage in the universal context of creation \( genesis 2 6 \) fourth , the term kol basar all flesh occurs 12 times in genesis 6 9 \( genesis 6 12 , 13 , 17 , 19 7 16 , 21 8 17 9 11 , 15 , 16 , 17 \) the word kol all \( which can occasionally express less than totality if the context demands \) , before an indeterminate noun with no article or possessive suffix , as here in genesis 6 9 , indicates totality god 's announcement to destroy all flesh \( genesis 6 13 , 17 \) and the narrator 's comment that all flesh died \( genesis 7 21 22 \) , except the inhabitants of the ark , indicates universal destruction the one occurrence of kol plus the determinate noun ha basar all the flesh \( in genesis 7 15 \) likewise indicates totality as well as unity fifth , the expression every living thing \( kol hahay \) of all flesh \( genesis 6 19 \) , is another expression of totality in 7 4 , 23 , the similar term kol hayeqm means literally , all existence this term is given further universal dimensions by the addition of the clause harking back to creation all existence that i have made \( 7 4 \) and by the exclusive statement only noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive \( 7 23 \) as hasel puts it there is hardly any stronger way in hebrew to emphasize total destruction of 'all existence' of human and animal life on earth than the way it has been expressed the writer of the genesis flood story employed terminology , formulae , and syntactical structures of the type that could not be more emphatic and explicit in expressing his concept of a universal , world wide flood \( hasel 1975 , p 86 \) sixth , the phrase under the whole heaven \( tahat kol haamayim , genesis 7 19 \) , is used six times in the ot outside of the flood narrative , and always with a universal meaning \( see deuteronomy 2 25 4 19 job 28 24 37 3 41 11 daniel 9 12 \) for example , the phrase is used to describe god 's omniscience for he looks to the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heavens \( job 28 24 \) again , it depicts god 's sovereignty whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine \( job 41 11 kjv \) \( note that the usage in deuteronomy 2 25 , describing the nations under the whole heaven , is further qualified and limited by the phrase who shall hear the report of you , and thus is potentially universal and not an exception to the universal sense \) the universal phrase under the whole heaven or under all the heavens also universalizes the phrase under heaven \( genesis 6 17 \) in this same flood context the word heaven alone can have a local meaning e g , 1 kings 18 45 , but here the context is clearly universal ecclesiastes , which contains numerous allusions to creation , likewise utilizes the term under heaven with a universal intention \( ecclesiastes 1 13 2 3 3 1 cf the parallel universal expression under the sun in ecclesiastes 1 3 , 9 2 11 , 17 etc \) in the flood account this phrase under the whole heaven is part of two forceful verses describing the extent of the flood and the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered the waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward , and the mountains were covered \( 7 19 , 20 \) critical scholar john skinner notes that 7 19 , 20 not only asserts its the flood 's universality , but so to speak proves it , by giving the exact height of the waters above the highest mountains \( skinner 1930 1956 , p 165 \) the biblical language here simply cannot be explained in terms of a local sky , and certainly cannot refer to the local mountains being covered by snow , as some proponents of a local flood suggest h c leupold points out that the writer of vs 19 is not content with a single use of kol \( all \) in all the high mountains , but since 'all' is known to be used in a relative sense , the writer removes all possible ambiguity by adding the phrase 'under all the heavens ' a double 'all' \( kol \) cannot allow for so relative a sense it almost constitutes a hebrew superlative so we believe that the text disposes of the question of the universality of the flood \( leupold 1942 , p 301 302 \) seventh , hasel devoted an entire scholarly article to the phrase all the fountains mayenoth of the great deep tehm rabbah \( genesis 7 11 8 2 \) , and showed how it is linked with the universal deep \( tehm \) or world ocean in genesis 1 2 \( cf psalm 104 6 thou didst cover it the earth with deep tehm as with a garment the waters were standing above the mountains \) the breaking up and bursting forth \( i e , geological faulting \) of not just one subterranean water spring in mesopotamia , but of all the fountains of the great deep , coupled in the same verse with the opening of the windows of the heavens , far transcends a local scene hasel perceptively concludes that the bursting forth of the waters from the fountains of the 'great deep' refers to the splitting open of springs of subterranean waters with such might and force that together with the torrential downpouring of waters stored in the atmospheric heavens a worldwide flood comes about \( hasel 1974 , p 71 \) eighth , in another article , hasel \( 1978 \) shows how the hebrew bible reserved a special term mabbl which in its 13 occurrences refers exclusively to the universal genesis flood \( 12 occurrences in genesis , once in psalm 29 10 \) this word may be derived from the hebrew root ybl to flow , to stream the term mabbl , which in the flood narrative is usually associated with mayim waters , seems to have become a technical term for waters flowing or streaming forth and as such designates the flood \( deluge \) being caused by waters mabbl is in the old testament a term consistently employed for the flood \( deluge \) which was caused by torrential rains and the bursting forth of subterranean waters \( hasel 1978 , p 92 93 \) this technical term clearly sets the genesis deluge apart from all local floods , and is utilized in the psalm 29 10 to illustrate yahweh 's universal sovereignty over the world at the time of the noahic flood the lord sat enthroned at the flood , and the lord sits as king forever summarizing regarding the technical terminology used for the extent of the flood in genesis 6 9 , hasel writes the genesis flood narrative provides ample evidence of being an account which is to be understood as a historical narrative in prose style it expects to be taken literally there is a consistent and overwhelming amount of terminology and formulae which on the basis of context and syntax has uniformly indicated that the flood story wants to be understood in a universal sense the waters destroyed all human and animal plus bird life on the entire land mass of the globe to read it otherwise means to force a meaning on the carefully written and specific syntactical constructions of the original language which the text itself rejects \( hasel 1975 , p 87 \) iii other biblical evidence for a universal flood many additional lines of biblical evidence converge in affirming the universal extent of the flood and also reveal the theological significance of this conclusion we will summarize fourteen points that emerge from the biblical text first , the trajectory of major themes in genesis 1 11 creation , fall , plan of redemption , spread of sin is universal in scope and calls for a corresponding universal judgment we have already noted in reference to specific flood terminology the numerous allusions to the universal context of creation the creation of the heavens and the earth certainly is not local in scope according to genesis 1 2 likewise , the fall of humanity in adam and eve led to the sinful condition of the entire human race \( hadam \) , not just the inhabitants of mesopotamia \( see genesis 6 5 , 11 romans 3 19 5 12 \) again , the protoevangelium \( first gospel promise \) outlined in genesis 3 15 , involves the universal moral struggle between the spiritual descendants \( or seed \) of the serpent and the spiritual descendants \( seed \) of the woman , culminating in the victory of the representative messianic seed over the serpent \( see robertson 1980 \) this plan of redemption is certainly universal in scope in a similar way , the sinful condition of humankind described at the time of the flood includes more than those living in the fertile crescent from god 's perspective , not simply from the culturally conditioned local view of the narrator , we have the results of the divine investigative judgment and god saw that the wickedness of man \( hadam , humankind \) was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually \( genesis 6 5 \) such universal sinfulness naturally calls for universal judgment second , the divine purpose given for the bringing of the flood makes explicit its universal scope and the lord said , 'i will destroy man \( hadam \) , humanity whom i have created from the face of the earth both man , and beast , creeping things and birds of the air , for i am sorry that i have made them \( genesis 6 7 \) nothing less than a complete destruction of the human race \( except for noah , 6 8 \) seems envisaged given the length of time from creation \( over 1650 years minimum \) , the longevity of the antediluvians \( nearly a thousand years \) , and god 's command at creation to fill the earth \( genesis 1 28 \) , it is highly unlikely that the pre flood population would have stayed only in mesopotamia thus the destruction of humanity would necessitate more than a local flood third , the genealogical lines from both adam \( genesis 4 17 26 5 1 31 \) and noah \( genesis 10 1 32 11 1 9 \) are exclusive in nature , indicating that as adam was father of all pre flood humanity , so noah was father of all post flood humanity from the descendants of noah the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood \( genesis 10 32 \) , and the tower of babel experience spreads humanity across the globe \( genesis 11 1 19 \) striking extra biblical evidence that all human races , and not just the nations of the fertile crescent , are included in the descendants of noah , and retain memory of the universal flood , is found in the amazing prevalence of ancient flood stories throughout the world over 230 different flood stories are known and occur among the most diverse peoples of the earth \( see frazer 1918 , 1 105 361 nelson 1931 \) a world wide flood is by far the most frequently given cause for past universally destructive calamities in the folk literature of antiquity \( thompson 1955 , 1 182 194 \) a remarkable number of these oral and written traditions agree upon the basic points of the biblical account all humankind was destroyed by a great flood as a result of divine judgment against human sin , and a single man and his family or a few friends survived the deluge in a ship or other sea faring vessel the stories nearest to the area of the dispersion at babel are the closest in detail to the biblical account \( see heidel 1946 , jacobsen 1981 , and lambert and millard 1969 \) this vast body of ancient witnesses to a world wide deluge is powerful testimony to the historicity and universality of the biblical flood fourth , the same inclusive divine blessing to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth is given to both adam and noah \( genesis 1 28 9 1 \) this is another linkage between universal creation and the flood , between the original beginning and the new beginning as the human race at creation flows from adam and eve , so the postdiluvial humanity is populated through noah fifth , the covenant \( genesis 9 9 10 \) with its rainbow sign \( genesis 9 12 17 \) is clearly linked to the extent of the flood , and includes the whole earth \( genesis 9 13 17 \) if there was only a local flood , then the covenant would be only a limited covenant , and the rainbow sign of the all embracing universality of the divine mercy \( delitzsch 1888 1976 , 1 289 290 \) would be stripped of its meaning sixth , the viability of god 's promise \( genesis 9 15 cf isaiah 54 9 \) and the integrity of god in keeping his promise is wrapped up in the world wide extent of the flood this point cannot be underscored too heavily if genesis 6 9 describes only a local flood , then god has broken his promise every time another local flood has happened ! the only way god 's promise not to send another flood to destroy every living thing \( genesis 8 21 \) can be seen to have been kept is if the flood was a universal one and the whole human race outside the ark was destroyed seventh , the universality of the flood is underscored by the enormous size of the ark detailed in genesis 6 14 15 and the stated necessity for saving all the kinds of animals and plants in the ark \( genesis 6 16 21 7 2 3 \) a massive ark filled with representatives of all non aquatic animal plant kinds would be unnecessary if this were only a local flood , for these kinds could have been preserved elsewhere in the world yet the divine insistence in the biblical record is that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve representatives of all of the various kinds \( genesis 6 19 20 \) as a matter of fact , if only a local flood were in view , the building of any ark at all , even for noah and his family , would have been superfluous god could simply have warned noah and his family in time to escape from the coming judgment , just as he did with lot in sodom but the point of the narrative concerning the ark is that there was no other escape in the midst of the flood only noah and those who were with him in the ark remained \( genesis 7 23 \) eighth , the covering of all the high mountains by at least 15 cubits \( genesis 7 19 20 \) could not involve simply a local flood , since water seeks its own level across the surface of the globe even one high mountain covered in a local mesopotamian setting would require that same height of water everywhere on the planet 's surface in this connection we note that it is not necessary to postulate the existence of mountains as high as mt everest at the time of the flood , and thus to require waters covering the earth to a depth of six miles , as some proponents of a local flood suggest would be necessary \( see ramm 1954 , p 242 \) the antediluvian mountains were very possibly much lower than at present passages in the book of job and psalms may well be referring to the process of postdiluvian mountain uplift \( see job 9 5 28 9 and psalm 104 7 8 \) also in this connection we may address the objection that proponents of a local flood often raise , namely , that a world wide flood would imply that the earth 's surface was completely renovated during the flood year and thus prediluvian topography would have been exceedingly different from postdiluvian topography this implication , they claim , is in conflict with biblical evidence which strongly suggests that prediluvian geography did basically resemble postdiluvian geography \( young 1977 , p 210 \) reference is made particularly to the topographical descriptions in connection with the garden of eden the lands of havilah and cush , and the four rivers , two of which \( the tigris and the euphrates \) were familiar to the readers of genesis in moses' time what is not recognized in these arguments , however , is that although there are some similarities between the prediluvian and postdiluvian topography , there are more differences than similarities two of the rivers mentioned apparently no longer existed in moses' time the pishon and gihon are mentioned in terms of where they used to flow , in the postdiluvian areas of havilah and cush respectively the other two rivers the tigris and euphrates are described as coming from a common source in the garden of eden , certainly far different from their present courses thus the topographical descriptions in the early chapters of genesis are in harmony with a world wide flood also , it is likely that survivors of the flood would use familiar names for topographical features after the flood , even though the earth 's surface looked entirely different ninth , the duration of the flood makes sense only with a universal flood the deluge of rain from above and water from the fountains of the deep below continued 40 days \( genesis 7 17 \) , and all the highest mountains were still covered five months after the flood began the tops of the mountains were not seen until after seven months , and the flood waters were not dried up enough for noah to leave the ark until one year and ten days had passed \( see genesis 7 11 8 14 \) such lengths of time seem commensurate only with a universal and not a local flood tenth , the receding activity of the water \( genesis 8 3a , 54a \) is described by hebrew phrases which , in parallel with similar phraseology and grammatical construction for the to and fro motion of the raven \( genesis 8 7 \) , should be translated as going and retreating , \( see austin 1990 , p 218 hasel 1978 , p 93 \) and imply oscillatory water motion lasting for 74 days \( see genesis 8 3 5 \) the waters rushing back and forth like in ocean tidal movement as the overall level gradually decreased , supports a universal interpretation such as the oceanic energy impulse model of the flood \( austin 1990 , p 218 \) , but is incongruous with a local flood theory eleventh , the nt passages concerning the flood all employ universal language swept them all away \( matthew 24 39 \) destroyed them all , \( luke 17 27 \) he did not spare the ancient world , but preserved noah with seven other persons , when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly \( 2 peter 2 5 \) a few , that is eight persons , were saved through water \( 1 peter 3 20 \) noah condemned the world \( hebrews 11 7 \) a local flood would not have ended the antediluvian world as archer states , we have the unequivocal corroboration of the new testament that the destruction of the human race at the time of the flood was total and universal \( archer 1985 , p 208 \) twelfth , the nt flood typology assumes and depends upon not only the historicity , but also the universality , of the flood to theologically argue for an imminent world wide judgment by fire \( 2 peter 3 6 7 \) peter argues that just as there was a world wide judgment by water causing the unbelieving antediluvian world to perish , so in the antitype there must needs be a universal end time judgment by fire bringing about the destruction of the ungodly \( see davidson 1981 , p 326 327 \) thirteenth , key terms and motifs that we have already noted in genesis 6 9 converge to make a major theological statement the noahic flood is nothing less than the cosmic undoing or reversal of creation numerous biblical scholars have recognized this highly significant theological point of the flood narrative nahum sarna writes that the flood is a cosmic catastrophe that is actually the undoing of creation in other words , creation is being undone , and the world returned to chaos \( sarna 1989 , p 48 \) tikva frymer kensky describes the flood as the original , cosmic undoing of creation \( frymer kensky 1983 , p 410 cf frymer kensky 1985 , p 312 \) claus westermann speaks of the invasion of chaos into the created order the flood assumed cosmic proportions \( westermann 1974 1984 , p 434 \) umberto cassuto points out that at the high point of the flood , we see water everywhere , as though the world had reverted to its primeval state at the dawn of creation , when the waters of the deep submerged everything \( cassuto 1964 , p 97 \) david clines uses the apt term bouleversement or reversal of creation to depict the theological significance of the flood \( clines 1972 , p 136 \) for joseph blenkinsopp , the deluge is an act of uncreation , undoing the work of separation by returning everything to the primeval , watery chaos from which the created order first arose \( blenkinsopp 1992 , p 83 cf blenkinsopp 1971 , p 46 47 \) gerhard von rad vividly underscores the universal implications of this undoing or reversal of creation we must understand the flood , therefore , as a catastrophe involving the entire cosmos when the heavenly ocean breaks forth upon the earth below , and the primeval sea beneath the earth , which is restrained by god , now freed from its bonds , gushes up through yawning chasms onto the earth , then there is a destruction of the entire cosmic system according to biblical cosmology the two halves of the chaotic primeval sea , separated the one up , the other below by god 's creative government \( ch 1 7 9 \) , are again united creation begins to sink into chaos here the catastrophe , therefore , concerns not only men and beasts but the earth \( chs 6 13 9 1 \) indeed , the entire cosmos \( von rad 1972 , p 128 \) only a cosmic universal flood can theologically encompass the cosmic universal reversal or undoing of creation described in genesis 6 9 fourteenth and last , the cosmic reversal of creation is followed by a cosmic new beginning as clines states it the 'uncreation' which god has worked with the flood is not final creation has not been permanently undone old unities of the natural world are restored \( 8 22 \) , and the old ordinances of creation are renewed \( 9 1 7 \) \( clines 1972 73 , p 138 \) jacques doukhan has shown the precise literary parallels between the successive stages of re creation in the aftermath of the flood \( genesis 8 9 \) and the seven days of creation in genesis 1 2 \( doukhan 1987 , p 133 134 cf gage 1984 , p 10 20 \) the wind over the earth and waters gen 8 1 cf gen 1 2 division of waters gen 8 1 5 cf gen 1 6 8 appearance of plants gen 8 6 12 cf gen 1 9 13 appearance of light gen 8 13 14 cf gen 1 14 19 deliverance of animals gen 8 15 17 cf gen 1 20 23 animals together with men , blessing , food for men , image of god gen 8 18 9 7 cf gen 1 24 31 sign of covenant gen 9 8 17 cf gen 2 1 3 thus in the over arching literary structure of the re creation in the flood narrative , the universal dimension of the flood is underscored by detailed parallels with the cosmic creation account of genesis 1 2 iv conclusion in conclusion , the question of the extent of the genesis flood is not just a matter of idle curiosity with little at stake for christian faith for those who see the days of creation in genesis 1 as six , literal 24 hour days \( see hasel 1994 \) , a universal flood is an absolute necessity to explain the existence of the geologic column a literal creation week is inextricably linked with a world wide flood but a universal flood is crucial not only in seeking to reconcile science and scripture it is also pivotal in understanding and remaining faithful to the theology of genesis 1 11 and the rest of scripture \( for a more detailed discussion of the theology of the genesis flood in its canonical context , see davidson in press \) the many links with the universal creation in genesis 1 2 which we have noted

546@3,"the hidden agenda behind gun storage laws by david kopel in canada and great britain deceitful safe storage laws allow government invasion of gun owners` homes these laws are all part of the gun grabbers` wholesale attack on private gun ownership responsible gun owners store their guns safely for over a century , the national rifle association and other civic groups have done everything they can to encourage safe gun storage partly as a result , the fatal gun accident rate for both kids and adults has fallen to an all time low in spite of this , anti gun politicians , and the anti gun groups are working to turn safe storage into a tool for disarming the american public gun owners who think they have nothing to lose from a government takeover of gun storage should look at what has happened in countries such as canada and great britain there , gun owner apathy has allowed safe storage to become the platform for abolishing gun ownership for home protection , for invading the privacy and the homes of gun owners , and for attacking even the simple possession of firearms great britain british gun owners have a long tradition of going along with government proposals for reasonable restrictions on their rights but as many britons found out too late , a restriction that appears reasonable on paper may become quite unreasonable in practice british law merely mandates that guns be stored in a secure place but britain has a national gun licensing system , similar to the american system proposed by sarah brady of handgun control , inc because most police administrators in britain are intensely opposed to citizens owning guns , they use the storage law to make acquiring a gun license as onerous as possible if you want to obtain or renew a gun license in britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system although the law , even today , does not order guns to be locked in a safe , the police routinely compel gun owners to purchase safes sometimes two safes , the second one for separate storage of ammunition a person buying a low powered l5 rimfire rifle may have to spend 100 on a safe a person with five guns may be ordered to add a 1000 electronic security system one effect of the heavy security costs is to reduce the ability of middle income or poor people to legally own guns , a goal which has been a constant objective of gun control proponents throughout history of course , the requirement that guns be locked in safes makes it nearly impossible for the gun to be used for home protection and the british police establishment despises the idea of defensive gun ownership if you want to obtain or renew a gun license in britain , two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system the requirement that gun owners purchase safes was never democratically enacted by the british parliament rather , the requirement was invented by police administrators , who correctly recognized that any system requiring government permission to buy a gun can be manipulated by anti gun administrators \( similarly , in the united states , police administrators have used the brady act to deny handgun purchases by thousands of people with unpaid traffic tickets or other trivial offenses brady does not formally sanction such abuses , but by requiring government permission for handgun purchases , the act makes such abuses inevitable \) canada in canada , the criminal code prohibits careless storage of a firearm , and gives the government the authority to create storage regulations what does this mean in practice \? consider some cases from 1996 and 1997 hearing suspicious sounds , perhaps from a burglar , a husband took his unloaded rifle with him one night when he looked around his house a few days later , the wife told a friend about the incident aghast , the friend called the police the police arrived at the couple`s home and bullied their way in searching the home , they found the unloaded rifle under a mattress in the bedroom no children lived in the home the couple was charged with careless storage of a firearm a 67 year old single woman ran a small boarding house in ontario a downstairs tenant began harassing and stalking her worried that the woman might pose a threat to the tenant , the police searched her apartment and found several unloaded guns in her closets she was convicted of storage of a firearm in violation of government regulations she had been attending school and studying to become a paralegal , but her conviction will bar her from a job in the legal field recently in winnipeg , a 72 year old woman called a hospital to request that a visiting nurse come over and help her with some medication someone from the hospital asked if the woman had any firearms in the home yes , she replied , my husband has a couple of old hunting rifles down in the rec room the police came over immediately and began searching the home they found several long guns , each with a trigger lock and locked to a rack in the basement they also found a 25 caliber pistol locked in a bedroom closet , which they had broken into the 73 year old husband came home in the middle of the search , and was immediately handcuffed , and accused of being violent other than the fact that he owned guns , there was no evidence that he was violent \( his neighbors later signed statements saying they had known him for years , and he had always been peaceful \) eventually the police removed the handcuffs , and told the man that he had never been under arrest gun storage laws sometimes provide a means for police to justify outrageously bad police work in medicine hat , alberta , a criminal who had charges pending against him tried to buy leniency by claiming that a man named larry davies was a marijuana dealer , with over a pound in his house the medicine hat police did nothing to verify the informant`s claim , other than looking up larry davies` address in the phone book the swat team , apparently having nothing else to do that day , broke into the davies household , and forced larry davies and three friends to the floor , pointing submachine guns at their heads a search of the house revealed mrs davies and her newborn baby , who had come home from the hospital that day four grams of marijuana \( weighing less than a united states 25 cent piece \) and a disassembled fn fal rifle in a basement closet apparently embarrassed but not repentant about the sloppy police practices and wanton show of force , the government charged mr davies with unsafe storage of a firearm happily , a judge threw the charges out of court , noting that whatever mr davies had done was much less of a threat to society than what the police had done and canadian courts have sometimes stopped other abusive prosecutions related to gun storage laws but even then , the victim of the abusive prosecution must spend thousands of dollars in legal fees to avoid a prison sentence of up to two years as david tomlinson , president of canada`s national firearms association , points out , gun storage laws are unenforceable without random police searches of the home canada`s newest gun law , which goes into effect next year , gives the police the authority to inspect private homes to ensure that gun storage laws are being complied with gun storage laws are like laws barring married couples from using birth control they are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home in 1965 , the united states supreme court struck down a birth control ban for this very reason \( griswold v connecticut , 381 u s 479 \( 1965 \) \) for the same reason , privacy minded legislators and citizens should reject turning the government into the home gun storage enforcer former president clinton , by the way , effusively praised the new canadian gun law \( bill c 68 \) which authorizes searches without probable cause small steps gun prohibition almost always moves by incremental steps restrictions that would have seemed outrageous if proposed by themselves can appear reasonable when they merely advance existing restrictions a few more steps gun storage laws are unenforceable without massive government intrusions into the sanctity of the home in canada , prohibitionists , such as then justice minister alan rock , have used gun storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration , since registration will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe storage laws that are in effect as the next step , the anti gun lobbies in canada have begun pushing for community storage rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home , you would have to keep your guns at a police station when you wanted to use your gun for the day , you could check it out from the police station the anti gun groups point out that a gun in the home could be stolen , or could be misused in a domestic incident there is no reason , they argue , for guns to be kept in a home 365 days a year , when the gun may only be used a few days a year to counter the anti gun groups , gun owners in canada can hardly argue that removing guns from the home makes it impossible to use the guns for home defense they gave up the moral case for self defense years ago by arguing that gun ownership was justified for sporting purposes , but not daring to assert that gun ownership is justified for defensive purposes and by agreeing to safe storage laws , the canadian gun owners gave up the practical ability to use a gun for self defense in a sudden emergency with so much ground already conceded , canadian gun owners are reduced to arguing minor points , such as how a centralized gun storage repository might be more vulnerable to theft even conceding on the community storage issue will do gun owners no good in 1996 , the british parliament banned almost all handguns , but allowed owners of single shot 22s to keep the guns locked in central repositories at gun ranges the new restrictions only briefly sated the appetite of the british anti gun lobbies in 1997 , community storage was replaced by its logical consequence , complete prohibition of all handguns the future who can believe that the right to keep and bear arms could survive community storage , with gun owners needing to ask government bureaucrats for permission to obtain access to their own guns \? who can believe that the american anti gun lobbies , who so consistently imitate the programs of their foreign cousins , will not begin demanding community storage , once they have laid the foundation with safe storage laws \? storing guns safely is the duty of every gun owner what makes for safety depends very much on individual circumstances safety is , and always has been , the concern of organizations such as the national rifle association in the hands of anti gun lobbies and government bureaucrats , though , safe storage becomes an orwellian term designed to negate the many safety benefits of the right to bear arms home safety is the responsibility of the family , not

bad design does not equate to no design it really is a poor argument much of the force of darwin 's arguments deal with bad design i invite anyone to post any of darwin 's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of bad design that said , consider this , your car is said to operate at 25 fuel efficiency one could claim then the car is 75 bad design , therefore it is not designed , and if it is , certainly not by anyone of any intelligence your audio cd 's have reed solomon error correction because the read write process is full of errors that need correcting cleary this is bad design that engineers would create read write heads that make so many errors in the first place same with modems and host of other devices clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design , the designers must be clueless ! poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes clearly a drama \( even a divine drama \) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story all the characters should be pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending life and the divine drama , like cd 's and cars , are clearly not designed , or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence , because of all the bad design woven into the designs the reason audio cd 's have so many read write errors which are corrected reed solomon error correction \( somewhat like us reading someone 's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors \) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a cd as possible the tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the shannon capacity theorem the mp3 's and jpegs are even more error prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture , but the goal was not fidelity but compactness a similar consideration is for the 75 inefficiency for cars the goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost , etc , not fuel efficiency the point is bad design , in the grand scheme of things , might not be bad design after all the high rate of sickness and death , the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the designer is unwise , any more than the many errors in the read write process of audio cd suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent origin of species chapter 13 there is another and equally curious branch of the present subject namely , the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class , but of the different parts or organs in the same individual most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae the anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous we see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans it is familiar to almost every one , that in a flower the relative position of the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils , as well as their intimate structure , are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves , arranged in a spire in monstrous plants , we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals , and in flowers , that organs which when mature become extremely different , are at an early stage of growth exactly alike how inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation ! why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone \? as owen has remarked , the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals , will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat , used as they are for such totally different purposes \? why should one crustacean , which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts , consequently always have fewer legs or conversely , those with many legs have simpler mouths \? why should the sepals , petals , stamens , and pistils in any individual flower , though fitted for such widely different purposes , be all constructed on the same pattern \? on the theory of natural selection , we can satisfactorily answer these questions homology was a pre darwinian idea with the term coined by owen who rather despised darwin and his ideas darwin tries to argue why a designer would not use the same for the same function he says homology is evidence of an unwise design the premise is a creator would n't be so inefficient but , unless one has a handle on the teleological goal , one is free to fabricate all manner of bad design arguments \( for example read write errors in audio cd 's or fuel inefficient cars \) the biotic message theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one designer and author of life , and that life could not have evolved like a great novel , the imperfections of biology are part of a larger plot it is turning out , darwin 's argument from homology is a concept in crisis",evolution,1,0,0,0

610@1,"evolution theory is not science at all , it is faith period how can i conclude that \? because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias ideology godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory","well , now , here 's the thing a hypothesis of special creation of all things \( such as is described in the bible \) is inconsistent with the evidence we can elicit from living things today for instance , there 's the amount of non functional dna we share with other creatures , in particular the other apes with shared functional dna , now , one could make a case for economy of design , but deliberately putting the same broken genes and garbage dna into two entirely seperate species \? then there 's the fact that some creatures have far better 'designed' bits than others for no readily apparent reason a good example is the octopus eye , whose retina is supplied with blood from the rear rather than the front , both anchoring the retina more securely \( no detached retina problems \) and avoiding the 'blind spot' mammalian eyes possess there 's no reason at all for a designer capable of making an octupus to use the inferior mammalian design then there 's the issue of vestigial features vestigial does n't necessarily mean 'useless' , more properly it describes something that is 'overengineered' for the purpose it currently serves , and often looks very much like a crippled version of a feature possessed by some other species ostrich wings , for example , may be useful for balancing when running , or in mating rituals , but they do n't need to be wings in order to serve those purposes their complex and delicate internal structure is clearly 'designed' to allow flight , but their stunted development and the practical impossibility of such a big bird achieving self powered flight make them a vestigial structure again , what rationale can be made for this being the work of a designer \? then there 's the fossil record try as one might to twist the evidence to fit a biblical flood , it just wo n't go paleontologists have found spider tracks sandwiched in sandstone layers imagine , if you can , the delicate impressions of a spider 's footsteps surviving a deluge sufficient to suspend and deposit yards and yards of sand atop them hydrodynamic sorting of fossils , or burial order , does n't fit either , since it requires that we pretend all dinosaurs were large and slow moving \( they were n't \) and that all mammals are small , agile and fast moving \( they are n't \) on and on it goes if we take evolution off the table completely and look at the evidence before us , we have no explanation that fits special creation simply does n't add up with all creation myths falsified , what are we supposed to do \? just pretend the history of life on earth does n't matter , or should be ignored \? evolution is n't what you come up with when you apply atheist thinking evolution is what you come up with when you discount all the extant hypotheses that do n't fit the facts , be they religiously inspired or otherwise now , you may hold your hand up and complain that we 're not admitting the possibility of some kind of divine guiding hand steering or helping evolution and that 's fair enough we generally do n't , for two different reasons first , it does n't really add anything to the theory it does n't increase its power to explain what we see so while you can of course choose to believe that 's what 's happening , it does n't have any scientific value secondly , there 's arguably some merit in the attitude that religion has had its chance and blown it for thousands of years religions have claimed to bear upon their backs the infallible word of god now , if the bible had been saying all along centuries before the technology existed to verify it that god coaxed organisms into evolving from simpler organisms over millions of years , that would be compelling evidence that the bible was accurate and divinely inspired , since it would contain accurate predictions \( which no man could have made \) about what we should find when we look into our dna or beneath the ground but it does n't make those predictions so why should we now pay attention when intelligent design evangelists do a 6000 year too late handbrake turn and invent a new faith based explanation for the evidence \? after all , they have no divine mandate to do so it 's the bible that 's supposedly the word of god they 're just making stuff up as they go along",evolution,0,1,0,0

755@1,"as for procedures such as partial birth abortion and other attempts by the far right to limit third term abortion , my understanding \( and granted this is from word of mouth only \) is that the legislation proposed was too general and purposely included language that opened judicial paths toward banning all abortions for an example of this type of manipulation of law , if , in the murder of a pregnant woman , a law is introduced in which the killing of her fetus is also considered a murder \( making it a double murder \) , that opens judicial paths to counting the fetus \( at any stage \) as having the same rights against being killed as any other person legislators and judges alike are wary of the slippery slope and do pay attention to such intentional manipulations","just a couple of points first , i believe your characterization that it is the far right that is seeking to limit third term abortions is incorrect there seems to be large support on these forums from both the pro choice and the pro life side regarding third trimester abortions likewise , the general public seems to have been so upset with the supreme courts decision in stenburg that congress stepped in and passed a nearly identical statute to the nebraska law that statute cleared the senate with the support of 16 democrats , and it cleared the house with the support of 63 democrats that is not to ignore the fact that it is largely republicans that would go further than third trimester restrictions i am merely trying to point out that roe stands in the way of restrictions that we all support \( third trimester \) , and thus we all should hope for legal reform in this area secondly , the slippery slope argument is common , and i will address it in more detail later my basic point is that if we really do think that third trimester fetuses have a significant moral status \( and i take people at their word on this \) , than we should work to reform abortion laws in the united states and that reform , as i am trying to argue , must begin with the undermining of roe v wade note that i have not yet discussed whether roe v wade should be overturned i do plan on discussing the legal issues with this case but as of now , i am only trying to lay some groundwork for why that discussion is so important a lot of people that i speak with seem to think the law is so technical that it cannot be understood \( or is too hard to be understood \) , and thus they would rather not bother with it so , i am trying to address that and i am doing so by simply saying if one seriously wishes to restrict abortion in the third trimester \( which virtually everyone seems to \) , than one must seriously consider the legal aspects of the issue",abortion,1,0,0,0

760@6,"a lot of garbage has been bandied about concerning the emotional trauma a woman suffers after she has had an abortion there is no substantive , unbiased research on this topic but a cursory sampling seems to indicate that women who report great emotional trauma after an abortion were already mentally unbalanced , possibly subject to depression or dramatic mood swings or other mental disturbances prior to becoming pregnant and having an abortion i am inclined to believe that such emotionally disturbed women are incapable of making a rational choice in many instances and they probably would have suffered enormous emotional consequences whatever choice they made but , if one could survey a sizable group of women who were in command of their faculties and capable of making good and reasonable choices , what if these women experienced emotional trauma and greatly regretted their decisions my first question to them would be , why exactly did you choose abortion \? i would like to know if they were forced by poverty to make such a choice , thereby not having a free choice or , if they were forced because of the stigma against unwed motherhood and illegitimate birth , particularly if they came from a very religious household , to have an abortion to avoid shame both for themselves and for their families again , not a free choice another factor would be if a woman were pursuing a very desired career and having a child or being disabled by pregnancy would injure her professional prospects the workplace does not look kindly upon the demands of pregnancy , giving birth , being responsible for children america is not a very family friendly nation and women who are responsible for the primary care of children are severely penalized for having those responsibilities again , these women do not have a free choice in the matter","just to provide some evidence of how incredibly shallow your liberal justifications and imaginings are , here 's some light reading for you simone it 's from something called a book chapter 9 health more specifically , mental health in discussing abortion , and abortion for the mothers health , it is absolutely crucial to know what health means , legally and in practice , regarding abortion health was defined in detail by the u s supreme court the court said that abortion could be performed in the light of all factors physical , emotion al , psychological , familial , and the womans age relevant to the well being of the patient all these factors may relate to health roe vs wade , january 22 , 1973 and in its companion decision , maternity or additional offspring may force upon the woman a distressful life and future psychological harm may be imminent mental and physical health may be taxed by childcare there is also the distress for all concerned associated with the unwanted child , and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable , psychologically or otherwise , to care for it doe vs bolton , january 22 , 1973 44 in a concurring opinion , justice douglas further elaborated what health meant when , in law , it related to abortion he detailed if she had to endure the discomforts of pregnancy to incur the pain , higher mortality rate , and aftereffects of childbirth to abandon educational plans to sustain loss of income to forego the satisfactions of careers to tax further mental and physical health in providing childcare , and in some cases , to bear the lifelong stigma of unwed motherhood roe vs wade , january 22 , 1973 this definition of health has been adopted internationally as a result , in any nation , if abortion is al lowed for the womans health , that country permits abortion on demand unless other aspects of its laws add restrictions the world health organization of the united nations defined it as including social , emotional and economic well being of the woman as defined by the woman herself lets narrow it down to mental health , in the psychological sense , and askare there mental health reasons for abortion \? no ! the woman with mental health problems is far more likely to experience post abortion emotional and psychological problems than a more stable woman four classic references here are these women with a history of psychiatric disturbance were three times as likely to have some psychiatric disturbance after an abortion as others who had no such history e greenglass , abortion amp psychiatric disturbance , canadian psych assn jour , vol 21 , no 7 , nov 1976 , pp 453 459 dr charles ford and his associates at ucla reported the same finding the more serious the psychiatric diagnosis , the less beneficial was the abortion c ford et al , abortion , is it a therapeutic procedure in psychiatry \? jama , vol 218 , no 8 , nov 22 , 1971 , pp 1173 1178 the more severely ill the psychiatric patient , the worse is her post abortion psychiatric state e sandberg , psychology of abortion in comprehensive handbook of psychiatry , 3rd ed kaplan amp friedman publishers , 1980 all of these support the original official statement of the world health organization in 1970 serious mental disorders arise more often in women with previous mental problems thus , the very women for whom legal abortion is considered justified on psychiatric grounds are the ones who have the highest risk of post abortion psychiatric disorders then mental illness as a reason for abortion is just an excuse \? precisely what about psychological problems after abortion \? when your authors wrote handbook on abortion in 1971 , there were a few murmurings about post abortion problems , but little was known we then saw the negatives as mostly physical when we wrote abortion questions amp answers in 1985 , physical damage , while still a major problem , was given less emphasis , and negative psychological aftermath was being seriously investigated with the publication of this book , far more is known about what is now called post abortion syndrome which clearly is a post traumatic stress syndrome a post traumatic stress syndrome \? yes this type of problem was first seen in large numbers in vietnam veterans , but did not manifest it self until a decade after they returned the same ten year delay has been evident with abortion t keane , vietnam vets trauma disorder level at 15 , am med news , l abraham , dec 2 , 1988 , p 2 what is post abortion syndrome \( pas \) \? many women are very ambivalent about getting aborted but do go ahead those around her told her \( and she told herself \) that it wouldnt bother her when symptoms occur , she tells herself it cant be the abortion causing them , and then into play come her two major psychological defense mechanisms repression and denial for some this works successfully for others it shades off to manageable distress , to severe and life changing upset and even to suicide there is a delay \? yes ! her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief then , with repression and denial , she avoids the problem , usually for years 5 years is common , 10 or 20 not unusual but then , for some , the negative feelings bubble up and break through often the precipitating event is she has a baby , or a close friend or relative has a baby that she has close contact with she finds out she is sterile , or other life changing events what are the symptoms of pas \? guilt is ever present in many guises , along with regret , remorse , shame , lowered self esteem , insomnia , dreams and nightmares , flash backs , anniversary reactions there often is hostility , and even hatred , toward men this can include her husband , and she may be come sexually dysfunctional crying , despair and depression are usual , even at times with suicide attempts recourse to alcohol or drugs to mask the pain is frequent , sometimes leading to sexual promiscuity there is also a numbing and coldness in place of more normal warmth and maternal tenderness is this due to religious guilt feelings \? perhaps in some it is a factor , but most women re ported on in the early studies were unchurched at the time perhaps they had seen pictures of fetuses \? again , not most most did not know it was a baby when they aborted but ive heard that the american psychological association says that pas doesnt exist this group has been strongly pro abortion , and this definitely colors its thinking but during the past decade or more , there have been dozens of national conferences on pas there are many professional articles and about 15 books adding more and more authentication to its existence and knowledge about it further , every one of the almost 4 , 000 pro life pregnancy help centers in the u s now has found that an increasing percentage of their time is now devoted to treating pas women but so many studies deny pas true , and most are invalid for two reasons \( 1 \) timing most studies have investigated feelings for only a few weeks or months post abortion when she is still feeling relief that her problem is gone since the delay before pas symptoms intrude is often 5 years or more , these studies are invalid \( 2 \) superficiality her repression and denial push this deep into her subconsciousness if the survey is done by questionnaire or single interview , she routinely denies problems these studies are invalid only by lengthy psychological testing and counseling can she often admit to some symptoms , much less tie them to the abortion she so desperately wants to forget you mean most studies miss pas \? but most polls show few emotional problems only a sense of relief ! yes , but what women really feel at the deepest level about abortion is very different from what they say in reply to questionnaires a canadian study polled a group of women who had previously completed a questionnaire in which they denied having problems from an abortion one half of this group was randomly chosen for in depth psychotherapy what emerged from psychotherapy was in sharp contrast to the questionnaires , even when the woman had rationally considered abortion to be inevitable , the only course of action it was demonstrated that the conscious , rationalized decision for an abortion can co exist with profound rejection of it at the deepest level despite surface appearances , abortion leaves behind deeper feelings invariably of intense pain , involving bereavement and a sense of identification with the foetus i kent et al , emotional sequelae of elective abortion , british college of med jour , vol 20 , no 4 , april 1978 i kent , abortion has profound impact , family practice news , june 1980 , p 80 are there valid studies \?

suicide is rare among pregnant women , but much more common after induced abortion it is never re ported under maternal mortality from abortion , of course , even though it is causative the suicide rate after an abortion was three times the general suicide rate and six times that associated with birth the rate for women following a live birth was 5 9 per 100 , 000 following miscarriage 18 1 following abortion 34 7 they note that women frequently get short term post natal blues after having a baby , but that this rarely translates into suicide , and that the initial stress of having a child is transitional , the over all effect having a positive effect on womens health m gissler , abortion suicide link , br med j , dec 6 , 1996 then it is rare among pregnant women \?

lynn m paltrow , executive director of national advocates for pregnant women sums it up quite well in 1984 , south carolina 's supreme court created a state feticide law in a case where a man viciously stabbed his pregnant girlfriend , causing her , among other things , to lose her pregnancy in 1997 , south carolina used this law against a pregnant woman , cornelia whitner , who was charged with failing to provide proper medical care for her unborn child whitner had given birth to a healthy baby who tested positive for an illegal drug based on extrapolation of the state feticide law , ms whitner was convicted of criminal child abuse at sentencing ms whitner begged for drug treatment the judge responded , i think i 'll just let her go to jail regina mcknight was an indigent 22 year old woman with a drug problem she became pregnant and despite her problems had every hope of carrying her pregnancy to term , but the pregnancy ended in stillbirth the hospital reacted not by offering her counseling or drug treatment , but rather by helping build a criminal case against her eventually she was convicted of murder the south carolina medical association and other leading health groups concluded that there was no evidence that mcknight 's drug use caused the stillbirth moreover , no one in this case , not even the prosecution , believed that mcknight had any intention of harming the fetus or losing the pregnancy had mcknight intentionally sought to end her pregnancy by having an illegal third trimester abortion , her sentence would have been two years in jail but because of a law similar to the bill president bush just signed , she is today serving a 12 year sentence read more here another good article on the matter do pregnant woman have rights \? in 1984 , for example , a nigerian woman pregnant and hospitalized in chicago was forced to have a c section she refused the surgery because she planned to return to nigeria where she would be unable to access c sections for future births the hospital obtained a court order and forced her to undergo the procedure hospital staff tied her down with leather wrist and ankle cuffs while she screamed for help another hospital obtained a court order to force a pregnant woman to undergo a blood transfusion doctors yelled at and forcibly restrained , overpowered and sedated the woman in order to carry out the order in washington , dc , doctors sought a court order to force ayesha madyun to have a c section the doctors asserted that the fetus faced a 50 75 percent chance of infection if not delivered surgically the court , apparently viewing the pregnant woman as having no more rights than a slab of meat , said , a ll that stood between the madyun fetus and its independent existence , separate from its mother , was put simply , a doctor 's scalpel with that , the court granted the order and the scalpel sliced through ms madyun 's flesh , the muscles of her abdominal wall , and her uterus when the procedure was done , there was no evidence of infection angela carder at 27 years old and 25 weeks pregnant became critically ill she , her family and her attending physicians all agreed on treatment designed to keep her alive for as long as possible the hospital however called an emergency hearing to determine the rights of the fetus despite testimony that a cesarean section could kill ms carder , the court ordered the surgery because the fetus had independent legal rights as a result , ms carder not only lost her right to informed consent and bodily integrity she lost her life the surgery resulted in the death of both angela and her fetus all of these women were denied the right to bodily integrity and physical liberty and their fetuses were granted more rights than any legal person under law that line just about sums it up these laws are n't about saving the unborn , and neither is the pro life movement it is about controlling and punishing pregnant woman it is about taking rights away from the woman the moment of conception as if she no longer exists these people would not think twice about prosecuting a pregnant woman whos pregnancy results in misscarriage intentional , accidental , whatever",abortion,0,1,0,0

831@5,"excerpts from a recent report it has been claimed that in the united states , 'guns are used for defensive purposes about five times as often as they are used for crimes' 1 , 2 this claim is made even though the criminal chooses both the time and place of the crime , most households dont have guns , and very few of the individuals who own guns are carrying at any time after controlling for other aspects of the surveys , these surveys indicate that criminal gun use is far more common that self defense gun use for example , in may 2000 , a washington post national random digit dial survey asked 'not counting military service , have you ever been threatened with a gun or shot at \? ' twenty three percent \( 23 \) said yes in that same month \( may 2000 \) , a gallup national random digit dial survey asked 'not including military combat , have you ever used a gun to defend yourself either by firing it or threatening to fire it \? ' seven percent \( 7 \) of respondents said yes so how can anyone claim that there are more self defense gun uses than criminal gun uses \? they do so by comparing different types of surveys they compare the results of box b with box c ! however , it is completely inappropriate to compare estimates which come from two radically different survey methodologies second , there is no accepted understanding of what constitutes a criminal or a self defense gun use for example , criminals often believe that their gun use during a crime was in self defense the opportunity for a law abiding gun owner to use a gun in a socially desirable manner against a criminal during the commission of a crime will occur , for the average gun owner , perhaps once in a lifetime it is a rare event other than self defense , the use of a gun against another human is socially undesirable regular citizens with guns , who are sometimes tired , angry , drunk , or afraid , and who are not trained in dispute resolution , have lots of opportunities for inappropriate gun uses people engage in innumerable annoying and somewhat hostile interactions with each other in the course of a lifetime it should not be surprising that inappropriate , socially undesirable 'self defense' gun uses by people who believe they are law abiding citizens outnumber the appropriate and socially beneficial use of guns 6 http www hsph harvard edu research pring 2009 pdf what do we learn \? the claim that guns are used much more often in self defense is based on making inappropriate comparisons if the same survey methodology is used to measure both criminal and defensive gun use , many more people will report that they have been a victim of a gun crime than having used a gun in self defense most of the defensive gun uses reported in studies that ask every respondent directly about gun use are actually criminal uses of guns","i learned a few things from the post the author claimed most households dont have guns according to 1997 stats , 25 of all us adults owned firearms if you assume that there are typically two adults per household , that means 50 of households have guns , so the statement is false on a personal note , someone tried to break into my brother 's apartment shortly after he was married he quickly opened the door , yelled freeze mfer or i 'll blow your head off ! while holding a short barrelled shotgun and watched the perp himself being half asleep and in possession of a slightly modified shotgun , my brother did n't call the cops to report this self defensive use of a firearm",gun control,1,0,0,0

' is then 'about 300 major state and federal laws , and an unknown but shrinking number of local laws ' http www brookings edu es urban pu s gunbook4 pdf so why does the slippery slope fallacy keep appearing despite a supreme court ruling that stands in the way of it becoming a reality , a decline in the number of gun laws , and little or no credible evidence to suggest that gun control advocates really do intend to ban all guns \? could it be that pro gun extremists find it necessary to resort to the slippery slope fallacy because they find it otherwise difficult to make a convincing argument against reasonable and common sense gun laws aimed at protecting law abiding citizens from gun violence and the misuse of firearms \?","so galileo i shared your post and link with the author of gunlaws com bloomfield press alan korwin , and he said i could share this , and any reply he gets with you guys to jon s vernick lisa m hepburn a friend sent me a link to your paper on gun law counts http www brookings edu es urban pu s gunbook4 pdf your finding of approximately 300 major state gun laws appears to be incorrect california alone has 541 numbered statutes of gun law , twice what the federal government has passed we publish the gun laws for several states , and distribute books on the subject for 24 states our definition for a gun law , while slightly different than yours , is close enough and guides our selection with a need to include no extraneous material that would increase the girth and cost of our books if it affects private ownership , possession or use of firearms , it is included a huge list of laws that are not included , which would raise the counts dramatically , is printed in the front of each of our books \( e g , regs for police , criminals , military , native americans , federal officials , etc 55 numbered federal statutes deal solely with armed federal agents \) gun law counts are somewhat preposterous though because , for example , a single law can regulate numerous disparate subjects the brady law , for example , with its 3 , 000 words , controls airline baggage , point of sale purchases , development and maintenance of an fbi computer gun tracking system and much more counting it as one law would be hopelessly misleading if the goal is to determine how much gun law exists for specifics , i can tell you affirmatively that at last count there were 271 numbered federal gun controlling statutes texas had 226 arizona 183 florida 229 and virginia , in out just released 7th edition , has 193 your overall count of 300 would therefore seem to come up somewhat short , would n't you agree \? you 'll find background and and extended discussion of true counts here gunlaws com faq the real question though is this is there any criminal gun related activity that is not already banned \? the answer to that is no , and usually there are multiple bans for any nefarious activity you can imagine new proposals invariable seek to criminalize possession by the public , possession which is perfectly lawful and harms no one , creating victimless crimes , and malum prohibitum laws that reduce freedom that 's why new bills typically meet such stiff resistance is there a mechanism for you to amend your paper for brookings \? it 's certainly in your best interests to have accurate information in the public domain with your names attached",gun control,1,0,0,0

is dr olsen 's letter in it 's entirety national museum of natural history smithsonian institution washington , d c 20560 1 november 1999 open letter to dr peter raven , secretary praven nas org committee for research and exploration national geographic society washington , dc 20036 dear peter , i thought that i should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the national geographic society with the publication of feathers for t rex \? by christopher p sloan in its november issue , national geographic has reached an all time low for engaging in sensationalistic , unsubstantiated , tabloid journalism but at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature although it is possible that mr czerkas will later name the specimen identified on page 100 as archaeoraptor liaoningensis , there is no longer any need for him to do so because this latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full spread photograph of the specimen accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon , the name archaeoraptor liaoningensis sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in national geographic \( international code of zoological nomenclature , article 13a , i \) this is the worst nightmare of many zoologists that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist clearly , national geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters sloan 's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that the czerkases now plan to return it to china in washington , in june of 1996 , more than forty participants at the 4th international meeting of the society of avian paleontology and evolution , held at the smithsonian institution , were signatories to a letter to the director of the chinese academy of sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from china and encouraged the chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation there were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message thus , at least since mid 1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from liaoning offered for sale outside of china are contraband most , if not all , major natural history museums in the united states have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin the national geographic society has not only supported research on such material , but has sensationalized , and is now exhibiting , an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally , administratively , and perhaps legally , off limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions prior to the publication of the article dinosaurs take wing in the july 1998 national geographic , lou mazzatenta , the photographer for sloan 's article , invited me to the national geographic society to review his photographs of chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story at that time , i tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what national geographic intended to present , but it eventually became clear to me that national geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs sloan 's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that makes the news rather than reporting it his bald statement that we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists , so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing this melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology , which , of course , are never mentioned more importantly , however , none of the structures illustrated in sloan 's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact the statement on page 103 that hollow , hairlike structures characterize protofeathers is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct , so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical the hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the national geographic society is even worse , and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers a model of the undisputed dinosaur deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers , all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction the idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at nature and national geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program , which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion if sloan 's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia , it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken but it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed , national geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode sincerely , storrs

1163@6,"vermont legalizes gay marriage chicagotribune com chicagotribune com vermont legalizes gay marriage the associated press 6 57 pm cdt , april 7 , 2009 montpelier , vt the marriage proposal came not over a candlelit dinner or on a scenic mountaintop instead the couple were surrounded by a throng of gay rights supporters outside the vermont house chamber we have n't decided who 's going to propose to who yet , former lawmaker robert dostis said as he stood next to his longtime partner , chuck kletecka but we 've been together 25 years in september , and i think september 14th would be a nice wedding day sounds good to me , kletecka replied i accept the exchange came just after the vermont house narrowly achieved the two thirds majority necessary to overcome republican gov jim douglas' veto of a gay marriage bill vermont was the first state to give gay and lesbian couples legal recognition with its civil unions law in 2000 it jumped to the lead again tuesday after courts in three other states had legalized gay marriage , vermont became the first to have its legislature do so on its own bills to allow same sex marriage are currently before lawmakers in new hampshire , maine , new york and new jersey the three other states that allow same sex marriage connecticut , massachusetts and iowa moved to do so first through the courts , not their legislatures for a popularly elected legislature to make this decision is a much more democratic process because lawmakers have to answer to the voters every other november , said eric davis , a retired middlebury college political science professor courts typically deal with arcane points of constitutional law while legislatures debate some of the same principles , the process may become much more personal in vermont , some of the most gripping debate came when gay lawmakers took to the house floor last thursday and told their own love stories getting gay marriage approved in a political , rather than purely legal , forum is a big step , said boston university law professor linda mclain , an expert on family law and policy what may give courage to other legislatures is that this legislature managed to do it , she said she added that using the civil rights language of equality the measure in vermont was dubbed the marriage equality bill could help make gay marriage more acceptable elsewhere opponents said they , too , believe activists will be emboldened in other states and could attack the 1996 defense of marriage act , which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and provides that states need not recognize the marriage of a same sex couple from another state the vermont action comes just days after the iowa supreme court ruled that not permitting gay marriage there was unconstitutional to the millions of americans who care about marriage , we say , 'get ready president obama and democrats will use vermont as an excuse to overturn the bipartisan federal defense of marriage act , ' said brian brown , executive director of the national organization for marriage , which waged a radio campaign against the measure the next step is to ask the supreme court to impose gay marriage on all 50 states to date , the same sex marriage movement 's main gains have been in new england , which some attribute to yankee liberalism and the gradual acceptance of gay relationships after vermont 's groundbreaking civil unions law took effect in 2000 douglas had announced his intent to veto the gay marriage bill two weeks ago , saying he believed marriage should be limited to a man and a woman and calling the issue a distraction from more important economic and budgetary issues in tuesday 's vote , a yes was needed from two thirds of those present to override the governor 's veto the goal was easily achieved in the senate , which voted 23 5 , but in the house the vote was much closer , 100 49 the speaker 's announcement of the results to a packed statehouse chamber set off whistles and cheers among supporters whose hopes had been temporarily dashed when the governor announced he would veto the measure if it passed the legislature among the celebrants were kletecka and dostis , who recalled efforts to expand gay rights dating to an anti discrimination law passed in 1992 it 's been almost 20 years to get to this point , dostis said i think finally , most people in vermont understand that we 're a couple like any other couple we 're as good and as bad as any other group of people craig bensen , a gay marriage opponent who had lobbied unsuccessfully for a nonbinding referendum on the question , said his side was outspent by supporters by 20 1 the other side had a highly funded , extremely well oiled machine with all the political leadership except the governor pushing to make this happen , he said the fact that it came down to this tight a vote is really astounding the measure had only 95 yes votes when it passed the house on friday but some changed their votes tuesday rep jeff young , d st albans , who voted no twice because he 's philosophically opposed to gay marriage , joined most other democrats in voting to override douglas' veto i think if i wanted to continue my career here and have any chance of being effective , i had to vote with my caucus , he said you have some pet projects , you think you can help your district back home with things that need to happen i want to get a railroading bill through i would n't even have had a chance to testify , let alone get it through now , people will listen

complains an indignant supporter of abortion and how can you call yourself a loving christian if you would force a victim of violent rape to give birth to a rapist 's child \? every pro lifer has heard these same challenges in one form or another they are the emotionally charged questions designed to prove either 1 \) that pro lifers are insensitive fetus lovers , 2 \) or ethically inconsistent , allowing abortion for some circumstances but not others unfortunately , most pro lifers have difficulty answering these challenges because the issue of sexual assault pregnancies is so widely misunderstood typically , both sides of the debate accept the presumption that women with sexual assault pregnancies would want an abortion and that the abortion would in some way help them to recover from the assault thus , the pro lifer is left in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the sanctity of life is more important than the needs of the sexual assault victim with whom everyone should rightly sympathize but in fact , the welfare of the mother and child are never at odds , even in sexual assault cases both the mother and child are helped by preserving life , not by perpetuating violence the reason most people reach the wrong conclusion about abortion in cases of rape and incest is that the actual experiences of sexual assault victims who became pregnant are routinely left out of the debate most people , including sexual assault victims who have never been pregnant , are therefore forming opinions based on prejudices and fears which are disconnected from reality for example , it is commonly assumed that rape victims who become pregnant would naturally want abortions but in the only major study of pregnant rape victims ever done , dr sandra mahkorn found that 75 to 85 percent chose against abortion 1 this evidence alone should cause people to pause and reflect on the presumption that abortion is wanted or even best for sexual assault victims several reasons are given for not aborting first , approximately 70 percent of all women believe abortion is immoral , even though many also feel it should be a legal choice for others approximately the same percentage of pregnant rape victims believe abortion would be just another act of violence perpetrated against their bodies and their children second , some believe that their child 's life may have some intrinsic meaning or purpose which they do not yet understand this child was brought into their lives by a horrible , repulsive act but perhaps god , or fate , will use the child for some greater purpose good can come from evil third , victims of assault often become introspective their sense of the value of life and respect for others is heightened they have been victimized , and the thought that they in turn might victimize their own innocent child through abortion is repulsive fourth , at least at a subconscious level , the victim may sense that if she can get through the pregnancy , she will have conquered the rape by giving birth , she can reclaim some of her lost self esteem giving birth , especially when conception was not desired , is a totally selfless act , a generous act , a display of courage , strength and honor it is proof that she is better than the rapist while he was selfish , she can be generous while he was destroying , she can be nurturing if giving birth builds self respect , what about abortion \? this is a question which most people fail to even consider instead , most people assume that an abortion will at least help a rape victim put the assault behind her and go on with her life but in jumping to this conclusion , the public is adopting an unrealistic view of abortion abortion is not some magical surgery which turns back time to make a woman un pregnant instead , it is a real life event which is always very stressful and often traumatic once we accept that abortion is itself an event with ramifications on a woman 's life , then we must carefully look at the special circumstances of the pregnant rape victim will an abortion truly console her , or will it only cause further injury to her already bruised psyche \? in answering this question , it is helpful to begin by noting that many women report that their abortions felt like a degrading and brutal form of medical rape 2 this association between abortion and rape is not hard to understand abortion involves a painful examination of a woman 's sexual organs by a masked stranger who is invading her body once she is on the operating table , she loses control over her body if she protests and asks for the abortionist to stop , she will likely be ignored or told it 's too late to change your mind this is what you wanted we have to finish now and while she lies there tense and helpless , the life hidden within her is literally sucked out of her womb the difference \? in a sexual rape , a woman is robbed of her purity in this medical rape she is robbed of her maternity this experiential association between abortion and sexual assault is very strong for many women it is especially strong for women who have a prior history of sexual assault , whether or not she is presently pregnant as the result of an assault 3 this is just one reason why women with a history of sexual assault are likely to experience greater distress during and after an abortion than other women second , research shows that after any abortion , it is common for women to experience guilt , depression , feelings of being dirty , resentment of men , and lowered self esteem what is most significant is that these feelings are identical to what women typically feel after rape abortion , then , only adds to and accentuates the traumatic feelings associated with sexual assault rather than easing the psychological burdens of the sexual assault victim , abortion adds to them this was the experience of jackie bakker , who reports i soon discovered that the aftermath of my abortion continued a long time after the memory of my rape had faded i felt empty and horrible nobody told me about the pain i would feel deep within causing nightmares and deep depressions they had all told me that after the abortion i could continue my life as if nothing had happened those encouraging abortion often do so because they are uncomfortable dealing with rape victims , or perhaps out of prejudice against victims whom they see as being guilty for letting it happen wiping out the pregnancy is a way of hiding the problem it is a quick and easy way to avoid dealing with the woman 's true emotional , social and financial needs according to kathleen dezeeuw , i , having lived through rape , and also having raised a child 'conceived in rape , ' feel personally assaulted and insulted every time i hear that abortion should be legal because of rape and incest i feel that we 're being used by pro abortionists to further the abortion issue , even though we 've not been asked to tell our side the case against abortion of incest pregnancies is even stronger studies show that incest victims rarely ever voluntarily agree to an abortion 4 instead of viewing the pregnancy as unwanted , the incest victim is more likely to see the pregnancy as a way out of the incestuous relationship because the birth of her child will expose the sexual activity she is also likely to see in her pregnancy the hope of bearing a child with whom she can establish a true loving relationship , one far different than the exploitive relationship in which she has been trapped but while the incest victim may treasure her pregnancy because it offers her hope of release , and the hope of finding a nurturing love , her pregnancy is a threat to the exploiter it is also a threat to the pathological secrecy which may envelop other members of the family who are afraid to acknowledge that the abuse is occurring because of this dual threat , the victim may be coerced into an unwanted abortion by both the abuser and other family members for example , edith young , a 12 year old victim of incest impregnated by her stepfather , writes twenty five years after the abortion of her child throughout the years i have been depressed , suicidal , furious , outraged , lonely , and have felt a sense of loss the abortion which was to 'be in my best interest' just has not been as far as i can tell , it only 'saved their reputations , ' 'solved their problems , ' and 'allowed their lives to go merrily on ' my daughter , how i miss her so i miss her regardless of the reason for her conception abortion providers who ignore this evidence , and neglect to interview minors presented for abortion for signs of coercion or incest , are actually contributing to the young girl 's victimization they are not only robbing the victim of her child , they are concealing a crime , abetting a perpetrator , and handing the victim back to her abuser so that the exploitation can continue finally , we must recognize that the children conceived through sexual assault also have a voice which deserves to be heard julie makimaa , conceived by an act of rape , works diligently against the perception that abortion is acceptable or even necessary in cases of sexual assault while sympathetic to the suffering her mother endured at the hands of her attacker , julie is also rightfully proud of her mother 's courage and generosity regarding her own view of her origin , julie proclaims it does n't matter how i began what matters is who i will become that 's a slogan we can all live with",abortion,1,0,0,0
